# The Four Forces {#sec-four-forces}

*"How things influence each other"*

::: {.callout-note}
## Key Insight
Interactions in the framework reduce to four force categories: gravitational, electromagnetic, strong nuclear, and weak nuclear. Each arises from differential operations on the flux field.
:::

## Gravity

The weakest force, but the only one that always attracts.

### The Formula

$$
\vec{F}_g = G_{\text{bias}} \cdot \nabla\bar{\rho}(x)
$$

where:

- $\vec{F}_g$ is the gravitational force vector
- $G_{\text{bias}} = 0.01$ is the gravitational coupling constant (derived from $1/(b_3 + N_c)^2$)
- $\bar{\rho}(x)$ is the neighbor-averaged flux density at position $x$
- $\nabla$ denotes the discrete gradient operator

### Properties

- **Range**: Infinite (inverse-square falloff)
- **Strength**: Very weak
- **Sign**: Always attractive
- **Source**: Mass (energy density)

### How It Works

Gravity emerges from density gradients. Where density is uneven, particles experience a force toward higher density. This is why mass attracts mass—each creates a density gradient that pulls the other.

The inverse-square law emerges naturally from 3D geometry. A source creates a density field that falls off as 1/r². The gradient of this field gives force proportional to 1/r².

## Electromagnetism

The force between charged particles.

### Electric (Coulomb) Force

$$
\vec{F}_e = -q(x) \cdot \nabla\bar{q}(x)
$$

- Like charges repel (positive times positive gradient = push away)
- Opposite charges attract (negative times positive gradient = pull toward)

### Magnetic (Lorentz) Force

$$
\vec{F}_m = \beta_m \cdot (\nabla \times \vec{J}) \times \hat{J}
$$

Moving charges create magnetic fields. The curl of the current density (∇ × J) gives the magnetic field. Forces act perpendicular to both field and motion.

### Electromagnetic Strength

The fine structure constant $\alpha$ ≈ 1/137 = 0.00729 sets the strength of electromagnetic interactions.

## The Strong Force

The force that binds nucleons.

### Yukawa Potential

$$
\vec{F}_{\text{strong}} = g_s^2 \cdot \frac{e^{-m_\pi r}(1 + m_\pi r)}{r^2} \hat{r}
$$

where:

- $\vec{F}_{\text{strong}}$ is the strong force vector
- $g_s$ is the strong coupling constant (dimensionless)
- $m_\pi$ is the pion mass scale (sets the interaction range)
- $r$ is the separation distance in lattice units
- $\hat{r}$ is the unit vector pointing from source to target

### Properties

- **Range**: Very short (1-3 voxels)
- **Strength**: Extremely strong (100× electromagnetic)
- **Behavior**: Attractive at medium range, repulsive at very short range
- **Creates**: Stable triads (protons, neutrons)

### The Repulsive Core

At distances less than ~1 voxel, the strong force becomes repulsive. This prevents particles from collapsing into each other and allows stable structures.

## Emergent vs Imposed
- **Emergent**: Coulomb 1/r² form (from 3D geometry), gauge symmetry (U(1) from Gauss constraint)
- **Imposed**: Yukawa functional form (borrowed from nuclear physics), strong coupling value

See CLAUDE.md Chapter 6 for the complete distinction between features that emerge from the dynamics vs those that are phenomenologically imposed.
:::

## The Weak Force

The force responsible for transmutation.

### The Stress Measure

$$
S(x) = |\nabla \cdot \vec{J}| + |\nabla \times \vec{J}| + |\nabla\bar{\rho}|
$$

When stress S exceeds a threshold, the weak force can act.

### Transmutation

When weak force triggers:
1. Particle polarity flips (+1 ↔ -1)
2. Neutrino emitted
3. Energy conserved

This is how neutrons decay: d quark → u quark + electron + antineutrino

### Properties

- **Range**: Extremely short
- **Effect**: Changes particle identity
- **Rate**: Very slow compared to other forces

## Force Comparison

| Force | Relative Strength | Range | Mediator |
|-------|------------------|-------|----------|
| Strong | 1 | 10⁻¹⁵ m | Gluon |
| Electromagnetic | 10⁻² | ∞ | Photon |
| Weak | 10⁻⁶ | 10⁻¹⁸ m | W, Z |
| Gravity | 10⁻⁴⁰ | ∞ | Graviton? |

## Gauge Symmetries: The Deep Structure

The forces are not random—they arise from **gauge symmetries** of the flux field.

### U(1): Electromagnetism

The electromagnetic force has **U(1) gauge symmetry**: invariance under local phase rotations.

$$J \to J + \nabla\lambda$$

The Gauss constraint ∇·J = ρ is preserved under this transformation. The conserved quantity is **electric charge**.

| Component | Physical Meaning |
|-----------|-----------------|
| 2 transverse modes | Photon polarizations |
| 1 longitudinal mode | Constrained by Gauss law |
| Gauge invariance | Charge conservation |

### SU(2): The Weak Force

The weak force has **SU(2) gauge symmetry** from chiral flux doublets.

$$\Psi_L = \begin{pmatrix} \psi_\uparrow \\ \psi_\downarrow \end{pmatrix}_L$$

where:

- ψ↑ = J_x + iJ_y (positive helicity)
- ψ↓ = J_x - iJ_y (negative helicity)
- L = left-handed (from flux spiral direction)

SU(2) transformations rotate between up-type and down-type:

$$\Psi_L \to U\Psi_L, \quad U = e^{i\theta^a\sigma^a/2}$$

The gauge bosons are W⁺, W⁻, and Z⁰.

### SU(3): The Strong Force (Color)

The strong force has **SU(3) gauge symmetry** from the three spatial dimensions of the lattice.

| Color | Flux Alignment |
|-------|---------------|
| Red | J primarily along x-axis |
| Green | J primarily along y-axis |
| Blue | J primarily along z-axis |

SU(3) transformations rotate the color orientation. The eight gluons correspond to the eight generators of SU(3).

::: {.callout-note}
## Color Confinement
Why can't we see isolated quarks? Between separated quarks, the flux forms **tubes** rather than spreading. The tube energy grows with distance, so it's energetically favorable to create quark-antiquark pairs. Quarks are always confined in color-neutral combinations.
:::

## Parity Violation

The weak force violates **parity symmetry** (mirror symmetry).

### The Mechanism

The flux field has a preferred chirality:

$$\chi = \text{sign}(\vec{J} \cdot (\nabla \times \vec{J}))$$

The lattice update rules are NOT symmetric under χ → -χ:

- Left-handed particles feel the full SU(2) weak force
- Right-handed particles are SU(2) singlets

This is why neutrinos are only left-handed and antineutrinos are only right-handed.

### The Weinberg Angle

The mixing between U(1) and SU(2) is measured by the **Weinberg angle**:

$$\sin^2\theta_W = \frac{3}{13} = 0.2308$$

This value is **derived** from the Lemniscate-Alpha curve (Chapter 1.10), not measured and plugged in.

## Force Unification

At high energies, the forces merge.

### The Running of Couplings

Coupling constants change with energy scale:

$$\alpha(Q) = \frac{\alpha_0}{1 - \frac{\alpha_0}{3\pi}\ln(Q^2/m_e^2)}$$

- Electromagnetic: α increases with energy
- Strong: α_s decreases with energy (asymptotic freedom)
- Weak: Related to EM through Weinberg angle

### Grand Unification

At energy scale M_GUT ≈ 10¹⁵ GeV, all three gauge couplings converge:

$$\alpha_1 = \alpha_2 = \alpha_3 = \alpha_{\text{GUT}} \approx \frac{1}{42}$$

Above this scale, there is a single unified force with combined gauge group.

### The Hierarchy

```
Energy Scale    Force Structure
═══════════════════════════════════
10¹⁹ GeV       Planck scale (lattice)
10¹⁵ GeV       Grand Unified (single force)
10² GeV        Electroweak unification
1 GeV          Separate EM, weak, strong
0              Full four-force world
```

## Experiments

### Force Isolation
Turn off all forces except one. See how gravity alone causes clumping. See how EM alone causes charge separation.

### Strength Comparison
Same setup, different forces. See how the strong force dominates at short range, EM at medium range, gravity at long range.

### Equilibrium Finding
Balance multiple forces. Find configurations where gravity, EM, and strong forces balance to create stable structures.

## Implementation

```python
def compute_forces(particle, grid):
    F = [0, 0, 0]
    pos = particle.position

    # Gravity
    F += GRAVITY_BIAS * gradient(density_field, pos)

    # Electric
    q = particle.charge
    F += -q * gradient(charge_field, pos)

    # Magnetic
    B = curl(current_field, pos)
    F += BETA_M * cross(B, particle.velocity)

    # Strong (if nearby particles)
    for neighbor in nearby_particles(particle, 3):
        F += strong_force(particle, neighbor)

    # Weak (transmutation check)
    if stress(pos) > WEAK_THRESHOLD:
        maybe_transmute(particle)

    return F
```

## Concepts

- **gravity**: Mass attracts mass via density gradients
- **electromagnetism**: Charge interactions (electric and magnetic)
- **strong-force**: Short-range nuclear binding
- **weak-force**: Particle transmutation

## Transition

The forces are tuned by constants. But why these particular constants? Next, we explore the fundamental constants that determine the behavior of everything.
