# The Two Layers {#sec-two-layers}

*"The seen and the unseen"*

::: {.callout-note}
## Key Insight
The framework distinguishes two ontological layers: the continuous flux field (potential) and the discrete state field (manifestation). Dynamics in the former determine transitions in the latter.
:::

## Layer 1: Potential (Pre-Ontic)

Potential is **where something might happen**. It is not real in itself—it is the precondition for reality.

The flux field permeates the entire lattice, carrying energy-momentum information that determines where manifestation events can occur.

### Flux Vectors

The potential layer is characterized by flux vectors:

- **3D directional field**: $\vec{J} = (J_x, J_y, J_z)$
- **Propagates through void** at speed C (1 cell/tick maximum)
- **Flux magnitude = energy amplitude = density**

### Density

The density at any position is the magnitude of the flux:

$$
\rho = |\vec{J}| = \sqrt{J_x^2 + J_y^2 + J_z^2}
$$

where $\vec{J} = (J_x, J_y, J_z)$ is the flux vector. When $\rho \geq K_B$ (the manifestation threshold), genesis becomes possible.

### Frequency

Energy is related to frequency via:

$$
E = H \times f
$$

where $H = 1$ is the Planck constant in natural units and $f$ is the oscillation frequency. Higher frequency corresponds to higher energy, which affects time dilation for manifested particles.

### Wave Velocity

The time derivative of flux, used for wave equation integration. Waves propagate, interfere, and determine where manifestation occurs.

### Phase Accumulator

Each voxel maintains a local phase:

$$
\tau(x) \in [0,1)
$$

This accumulates based on local energy. When $\tau \geq 1$, the voxel is "active" for that tick.

## Layer 2: Manifestation (Ontic)

Manifestation is **when potential becomes real**. A discrete, local event.

The rules:
- **Intensity determines where**: Manifestation occurs in high-flux regions
- **Divergence sign determines what**: Matter (+1) vs antimatter (-1)
- **Once manifested**: Forces, collisions, decay apply

### The Split View

Imagine viewing the universe two ways simultaneously:

| Potential View | Manifestation View |
|---------------|-------------------|
| Flowing flux fields | Discrete particles |
| Continuous gradients | Point locations |
| Wave-like behavior | Particle-like behavior |
| Pre-ontic | Ontic |

Both views are valid. They show different aspects of the same reality.

## The Ocean Metaphor

Consider this analogy:

- **The ocean currents** = flux field (Layer 1)
- **Ships on the surface** = particles (Layer 2)

The currents are always there, flowing, interacting. Ships appear where currents are strong, move with the currents, and sometimes sink back into the ocean.

You can study the currents (potential) or the ships (manifestation). Both are real. But the currents are more fundamental—they determine where ships can exist.

## Experiments

### Wave Visualization
Create a flux disturbance. Watch it propagate through the void at speed C. See how it spreads, reflects, interferes.

### Genesis Prediction
Look at the potential field. Predict where genesis will occur based on flux density. Watch your predictions confirmed.

### Flux Painting
Draw patterns in the potential field. Observe how manifested particles appear in the high-density regions you created.

## Mathematical Details

### Wave Propagation

The flux field evolves according to the discrete wave equation:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \nabla^2 u
$$

## Derivation Source
This wave equation is derived from the FTD action principle S[s,J]. See THEORETICAL_FOUNDATIONS Part I for the complete derivation via Euler-Lagrange equations.

Discretized via velocity-Verlet:

1. Calculate Laplacian (neighbor average - center)
2. Update wave velocity
3. Update flux
4. Apply damping

### Voxel State

Each voxel maintains:

```
flux = [fx, fy, fz]         # Momentum vector
density = |flux|            # Energy magnitude
frequency = f               # Vibration rate
wave_velocity = [vx,vy,vz]  # For wave propagation
phase = τ                   # Local phase accumulator
```

## Concepts

- **flux-vectors**: The 3D momentum/energy field
- **density**: The magnitude of flux (|J|)
- **layer-one**: The pre-ontic potential layer
- **layer-two**: The ontic manifestation layer

## Transition

Now that we understand the two layers, we can see how they interact through interference—the geometry of possibility.
