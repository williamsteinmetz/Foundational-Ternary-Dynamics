# Stellar Death {#sec-stellar-death}

*"How stars end their lives"*

::: {.callout-note}
## Key Revelation
A star's mass determines its fate. Small stars fade quietly into white dwarfs. Massive stars explode as supernovae, seeding the universe with heavy elements.

## How FTD Produces Stellar Death
Stellar endpoints follow from the limits of flux support:

- **White dwarf** = electron degeneracy pressure (Pauli exclusion on flux states) halts collapse
- **Neutron star** = neutron degeneracy pressure after electrons merge with protons
- **Black hole** = no flux mechanism can support the core; collapse to singularity
- **Supernova** = gravitational potential energy released when core collapses faster than flux can respond

The Chandrasekhar limit (~1.4 M☉) emerges from the maximum electron degeneracy pressure.

## Low Mass Stars (< 8 M☉)

The path of Sun-like stars.

### Red Giant Phase

When core hydrogen exhausted:
1. Core contracts, heats
2. Shell burning begins
3. Envelope expands
4. Surface cools → red
5. Star swells to ~100× original size

### Helium Flash

In stars < 2 M☉:
- Degenerate core ignites helium
- Runaway fusion (seconds)
- Core expands, stabilizes

### Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB)

After helium exhausted:
- Double shell burning (H and He)
- Thermal pulses
- Strong mass loss
- Planetary nebula forms

### Planetary Nebula

```
       ┌─────────────────┐
       │                 │
       │    ○            │  ← Hot central star
       │                 │
       │                 │
       └─────────────────┘
         ↑ Expanding gas shell
```

Expelled envelope glows from UV radiation of hot core.

### White Dwarf

What remains:
- Carbon-oxygen core
- ~0.6 M☉ typically
- Earth-sized
- Electron degeneracy pressure
- Slowly cools forever

## High Mass Stars (> 8 M☉)

The path to supernova.

### Pre-Supernova

Multiple burning stages create onion structure:
- Each stage shorter than the last
- Iron core grows
- Silicon burning lasts only days

### Core Collapse

When iron core exceeds Chandrasekhar mass (~1.4 M☉):
1. Electron degeneracy fails
2. Core collapses in milliseconds
3. Neutronization: p + e⁻ → n + νₑ
4. Core bounces at nuclear density
5. Shock wave launches

### The Explosion

Energy release: ~10⁴⁶ J (99% in neutrinos)

### Supernova Types

| Type | Mechanism | Spectrum |
|------|-----------|----------|
| Ia | White dwarf thermonuclear | No H, strong Si |
| Ib | Core collapse, no H envelope | No H |
| Ic | Core collapse, no H or He | No H or He |
| II | Core collapse with H | H present |

### Remnant

What's left:
- Neutron star (8-25 M☉ progenitor)
- Black hole (>25 M☉ progenitor)

## Type Ia Supernovae

Special case: exploding white dwarf

### Mechanism

White dwarf in binary system:
1. Accretes matter from companion
2. Approaches 1.4 M☉
3. Carbon ignites throughout
4. Entire star explodes

### Standard Candles

All Type Ia have similar peak luminosity:
- Used to measure cosmic distances
- Led to discovery of dark energy

## Supernova Remnants

The debris expands for millennia:

### Stages

1. **Free expansion** (few hundred years)
2. **Sedov-Taylor** (thousands of years)
3. **Radiative** (tens of thousands of years)
4. **Merger** with ISM

Famous remnants: Crab Nebula, Cassiopeia A, Vela

## In Simulation

```python
def stellar_death(star):
    if star.mass < 8:
        # Low mass path
        star.become_red_giant()
        star.eject_planetary_nebula()
        return WhiteDwarf(star.core_mass)

    else:
        # High mass path
        star.burn_all_stages()
        core = star.build_iron_core()

        if core.mass > CHANDRASEKHAR:
            energy = core.collapse()
            return Supernova(star, energy)
```

## Experiments

### Red Giant Evolution
Watch Sun-like star expand into red giant.

### Core Collapse
Simulate collapse of massive star core.

### Supernova Explosion
Watch shock wave propagate through star.

## Concepts

- **red-giant**: Expanded star with shell burning
- **planetary-nebula**: Expelled envelope of dying star
- **white-dwarf**: Electron-degenerate remnant
- **supernova**: Explosive stellar death

## Transition

When massive stars die, they leave behind exotic objects—white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes. Next, we explore these compact objects.
