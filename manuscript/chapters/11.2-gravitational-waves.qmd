# Gravitational Waves {#sec-gravitational-waves}

*"Ripples in spacetime"*

::: {.callout-note}
## Key Insight
Gravitational waves—propagating disturbances in the spacetime metric—were predicted by general relativity [@einstein1916] and first directly detected by LIGO in 2015 [@abbott2016_gw150914].

## What Are Gravitational Waves?

Ripples in the fabric of spacetime, caused by accelerating masses.

### Production

When masses accelerate asymmetrically:
- Binary stars orbiting
- Supernovae (if asymmetric)
- Black hole mergers
- Cosmic strings (hypothetical)

### Propagation

Travel at speed c through spacetime itself.

## Properties

### Strain

$$
h = \frac{\Delta L}{L} \approx 10^{-21}
$$

For LIGO detections: 1/1000th the diameter of a proton over 4 km.

### Polarization

Two modes:
- **Plus (+)**: Stretches along one axis, compresses perpendicular
- **Cross (×)**: Rotated 45° from plus

```
Plus:        Cross:
○ → ○        ○   ○
              ╲ ╱
○   ○          ╳
              ╱ ╲
○ ← ○        ○   ○
```

### Speed

The propagation speed was confirmed to equal $c$ to within $10^{-15}$ by the multi-messenger observation of GW170817 [@abbott2017_gw170817].

## Sources

### Binary Black Holes

The primary source class for current detectors:

- GW150914: First detection, $36 + 29 \to 62\,M_\odot$ [@abbott2016_gw150914]
- Characteristic "chirp" waveform from inspiral
- ~90 confirmed events through O3 observing run [@gwtc3]

### Binary Neutron Stars

GW170817:
- First neutron star merger detected
- Electromagnetic counterpart
- Confirmed speed = c
- Heavy element production

### Supermassive Binaries

LISA (future) targets:
- Merging galaxy centers
- 10⁶-10⁷ M☉
- Millihertz frequencies

### Primordial

From early universe:
- Inflation
- Phase transitions
- Cosmic strings

## The Waveform

### Inspiral

```

$$
f \propto t^{-3/8}
$$

### Merger

Maximum amplitude, complex dynamics, peak frequency.

### Ringdown

Damped oscillations as final black hole settles:
$$
h(t) \propto e^{-t/\tau} \cos(\omega t)
$$

## Detection

### LIGO/Virgo

Laser interferometers:

Arms: 4 km
Sensitivity: 10⁻²¹ strain
```

### How It Works

1. Laser split into two arms
2. GW stretches one arm, compresses other
3. Light returns out of phase
4. Interference pattern changes

### Detections

Since 2015:
- ~90 confirmed events
- Mostly BBH mergers
- Some BNS, BHNS

## Science from GW

### Tests of General Relativity

- GW speed = c (confirmed)
- Polarization = 2 modes (confirmed)
- Waveform matches prediction (confirmed)

### Astrophysics

- Black hole masses and spins
- Merger rates
- Neutron star equation of state
- Hubble constant (standard sirens)

### Cosmology

- Independent distance measure
- Dark energy constraints
- Early universe physics (future)

## Future Detectors

| Detector | Frequency | Targets |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| LIGO/Virgo | 10-1000 Hz | Stellar BH, NS |
| LISA | 0.1-100 mHz | SMBH, EMRIs |
| Pulsar timing | nHz | SMBH binaries |
| Einstein Telescope | 1-10000 Hz | All stellar |

## In Simulation

```python
def gravitational_wave(binary_system, distance):
    m1, m2 = binary_system.masses
    chirp_mass = (m1 * m2)**(3/5) / (m1 + m2)**(1/5)
    f = binary_system.orbital_frequency

    # Strain amplitude
    h = (4 * G * chirp_mass / c**2 / distance) * \
        (pi * G * chirp_mass * f / c**3)**(2/3)

    return h

def inspiral_waveform(t, chirp_mass):
    # Frequency evolution (chirp formula)
    M = G * chirp_mass / c**3
    f = (256/5 * M**(-5/3) * t)**(-3/8)

    # Phase
    phi = integrate(2 * pi * f, t)

    return h_0 * cos(phi)
```

## Experiments

### Binary Inspiral
Watch two black holes spiral together. See frequency increase.

### Detection Simulation
Inject GW signal. Extract from noise.

### Merger Dynamics
Watch final plunge and ringdown.

## Concepts

- **strain**: Fractional length change
- **chirp**: Rising frequency inspiral
- **ringdown**: Post-merger oscillation
- **interferometer**: Detection method

## Transition

Gravitational waves come from the most violent events. But high-energy particles also rain down from space—cosmic rays.
