*"The solid foundation of worlds"*

::: {.callout-note}
## Key Revelation
Planets are not static—their interiors churn, their surfaces crack, and their mountains rise over millions of years. Geology is planetary dynamics in slow motion.

## Planetary Interiors

### Structure

Planets differentiate into layers based on density:

```
    ┌─────────────┐
    │   Crust     │ ← Light silicates
    ├─────────────┤
    │             │
    │   Mantle    │ ← Dense silicates
    │             │
    ├─────────────┤
    │  Outer core │ ← Liquid metal
    ├─────────────┤
    │ Inner core  │ ← Solid metal
    └─────────────┘
```

### Heat Budget

| Source | Power | Duration |
|--------|-------|----------|
| Radioactive decay | ~20 TW | Ongoing |
| Residual accretion | Decreasing | Initial |
| Core crystallization | ~5 TW | Ongoing |

Earth's interior is still hot from formation + radioactive heating.

## Plate Tectonics

### Driving Forces

- **Mantle convection**: Hot material rises, cold sinks
- **Ridge push**: New crust pushes plates apart
- **Slab pull**: Dense subducting plates pull

### Plate Boundaries

| Type | Motion | Features |
|------|--------|----------|
| Divergent | Apart | Mid-ocean ridges |
| Convergent | Together | Trenches, mountains |
| Transform | Sliding | Earthquakes |

### The Rock Cycle

```
    Igneous ─── weathering ──→ Sediment
       ↑                           ↓
    melting                    burial
       ↑                           ↓
    Metamorphic ←─ heat/pressure ─ Sedimentary
```

## Volcanism

### Magma Types

| Type | SiO₂ | Viscosity | Eruption |
|------|------|-----------|----------|
| Basaltic | 45-52% | Low | Effusive |
| Andesitic | 52-63% | Medium | Mixed |
| Rhyolitic | >63% | High | Explosive |

### Volcano Types

- **Shield**: Broad, gentle (Hawaii)
- **Stratovolcano**: Steep, explosive (Mt. Fuji)
- **Caldera**: Collapsed supervolcano (Yellowstone)

### Volcanic Products

- **Lava**: Flowing molten rock
- **Tephra**: Ejected fragments
- **Gases**: CO₂, H₂O, SO₂
- **Pyroclastic flows**: Deadly hot gas + debris clouds

## Earthquakes

### Causes

- Fault rupture (tectonic)
- Volcanic activity
- Human activity (induced)

### Magnitude

Richter scale (logarithmic):
$$
M = \log_{10}(A) + \text{corrections}
$$

Each unit = 10× more amplitude, 31.6× more energy.

### Seismic Waves

| Type | Motion | Speed | Travel |
|------|--------|-------|--------|
| P-wave | Compression | Fastest | Through all |
| S-wave | Shear | Medium | Solids only |
| Surface | Rolling | Slowest | Surface |

## Comparative Geology

### Mars

- Dead tectonics (one plate)
- Giant volcanoes (Olympus Mons)
- Ancient river valleys
- No magnetic field

### Venus

- Active volcanism
- No plate tectonics
- Resurfacing events
- Thick atmosphere

### Moon

- Heavily cratered
- Ancient mare (basalt flows)
- No tectonics, no atmosphere
- Seismically quiet

## In Simulation

```python
class Planet:
    def __init__(self, mass, composition):
        self.layers = differentiate(mass, composition)
        self.plates = []
        self.heat = initial_heat(mass)

    def evolve(self, dt):
        # Convection
        self.mantle_flow = convection(self.layers['mantle'])

        # Plate motion
        for plate in self.plates:
            plate.move(self.mantle_flow)

        # Volcanism
        if pressure_release(self.layers):
            create_volcano()

        # Heat loss
        self.heat -= surface_radiation(dt)
```

## Experiments

### Plate Motion
Watch plates move over millions of simulated years. See continents drift.

### Volcano Builder
Set up conditions. Watch eruptions based on magma type.

### Earthquake Waves
Trigger quake. Watch P and S waves propagate.

## Concepts

- **plate-tectonics**: Moving crustal plates
- **convection**: Heat-driven circulation
- **volcanism**: Molten rock reaching surface
- **seismology**: Study of earthquakes

## Transition

Solid ground and gaseous atmosphere need protection. Next, we explore magnetospheres—the invisible shields that protect worlds from space.
