# Heat Death {#sec-heat-death}

*"The final equilibrium"*

::: {.callout-note}
## Key Revelation
All processes require energy gradients. When the last gradient flattens, when the final star burns out, when everything reaches the same temperature—the universe dies not with a bang, but with a whisper fading into eternal silence.

## The Second Law's Endgame

### Entropy Always Wins

$$
dS_{total} \geq 0
$$

Every process:
- Uses energy gradients
- Creates entropy
- Moves toward equilibrium

Eventually, no gradients remain.

### The Timeline

| Era | Time (years) | Events |
|-----|--------------|--------|
| Stelliferous | Now - 10¹⁴ | Stars shine |
| Degenerate | 10¹⁴ - 10⁴⁰ | White dwarfs, neutron stars cool |
| Black Hole | 10⁴⁰ - 10¹⁰⁰ | Only black holes remain |
| Dark | 10¹⁰⁰+ | Black holes evaporate |
| Heat Death | ∞ | Final equilibrium |

## The Stelliferous Era Ends

### Last Stars Form (~10¹⁴ years)

Star formation requires:
- Gas to collapse
- Gravity to compress
- Fusion to ignite

Eventually:
- All gas locked in remnants
- No new stars possible
- Last red dwarf fades

### The Final Stellar Light

Red dwarfs live longest (~10¹³ years):
- M-class, 0.1 M☉
- Slow, efficient burning
- When the last one dies, starlight ends forever

## The Degenerate Era

### What Remains

After stars die:
- White dwarfs (cooling carbon/oxygen)
- Neutron stars (cooling nuclear matter)
- Black holes (slowly evaporating)
- Brown dwarfs (never ignited)
- Planets (frozen, dark)

### White Dwarf Cooling

$$
T(t) \propto t^{-2/5}
$$

Cooling takes 10¹⁵+ years to approach background.

### Black Dwarf Formation

Eventually white dwarfs become black dwarfs:
- Too cold to radiate visibly
- Crystalline carbon/oxygen
- Dark, cold cinders

(None exist yet—universe too young)

## The Black Hole Era

### Black Holes Dominate

By 10⁴⁰ years:
- Stellar remnants have decayed or merged
- Only black holes remain significant
- Plus radiation and sparse particles

### Hawking Evaporation

$$
t_{evap} = \frac{5120 \pi G^2 M^3}{\hbar c^4}
$$

| Mass | Evaporation Time |
|------|-----------------|
| 1 M☉ | 10⁶⁷ years |
| 10⁶ M☉ | 10⁸⁷ years |
| 10⁹ M☉ | 10⁹⁶ years |
| 10¹² M☉ | 10¹⁰⁵ years |

### The Final Black Hole

Supermassive black holes last longest.

The very last one evaporates around 10¹⁰⁰ years:
- Final flash of Hawking radiation
- Then: nothing but particles

## The Dark Era

### What's Left

After 10¹⁰⁰ years:
- Photons (redshifted to near zero energy)
- Neutrinos (incredibly sparse)
- Electrons and positrons (if stable)
- Protons (if stable) or their decay products

### Proton Decay?

Grand unified theories predict:
$$
\tau_p \approx 10^{34} - 10^{45} \text{ years}
$$

If protons decay:
- All baryonic matter eventually dissolves
- Only leptons and photons remain

### Temperature Approaches Zero

Expansion redshifts everything:
$$
T \propto \frac{1}{a(t)}
$$

Temperature asymptotes to zero but never reaches it.

## True Heat Death

### Definition

Heat death = thermal equilibrium everywhere:
- Same temperature throughout
- No energy gradients
- No possible work
- Maximum entropy

### The Final State

```
∞ years from now:
─────────────────────────────────────────
Temperature: ~10⁻³⁰ K (approaching 0)
Density: ~10⁻¹²³ kg/m³ (approaching 0)
Contents: Scattered photons, neutrinos
Events: Essentially none
Entropy: Maximum
Time: Meaningless (nothing changes)
─────────────────────────────────────────
```

### Does Time End?

If nothing changes, does time exist?

Philosophically ambiguous:
- Time continues (spacetime exists)
- Time is meaningless (no events to order)

## In the Simulation

### Modeling Heat Death

```python
def simulate_heat_death(universe, max_ticks=10**15):
    for tick in range(max_ticks):
        universe.step()

        # Check for heat death conditions
        temp_variance = compute_temperature_variance(universe)
        particle_count = count_particles(universe)
        structure_count = count_structures(universe)

        if (temp_variance < EPSILON and
            structure_count == 0 and
            particle_count < THRESHOLD):
            print(f"Heat death at tick {tick}")
            return tick

    return "Still evolving"

def heat_death_state():
    # Final configuration
    return {
        'state': 0,  # All void
        'flux': [0, 0, 0],  # No momentum
        'density': 0,  # No energy density
        'structures': [],  # No organization
        'entropy': 'maximum'
    }
```

### Acceleration in Simulation

Real heat death: 10¹⁰⁰+ years
Simulation: Increase DECAY_RATE to observe faster

```python
def accelerated_heat_death():
    # Normal: DECAY_RATE = 0.00729
    # Accelerated: DECAY_RATE = 0.1

    universe = create_universe(decay_rate=0.1)

    while not is_heat_death(universe):
        universe.step()
        observe(universe)
```

## Philosophical Implications

### The Universe's Purpose?

If universe ends in heat death:
- Was there a point?
- Does meaning require permanence?
- Or is the journey sufficient?

### Boltzmann Brains

In eternal equilibrium:
- Random fluctuations still occur
- Eventually, a brain-like fluctuation
- "Boltzmann brain" observes briefly
- Then dissolves

Problem: More Boltzmann brains than real observers?

### Eternal Recurrence?

Poincaré recurrence theorem:
- Finite system returns to initial state
- Given infinite time

But: Expanding universe isn't finite bounded system.

## Experiments

### Entropy Maximization
Watch universe approach maximum entropy. See structure dissolve.

### Cooling Simulation
Track temperature as universe ages. See asymptotic approach to zero.

### Decay Cascade
Follow final particles as everything evaporates.

## Concepts

- **heat-death**: Final thermal equilibrium
- **stelliferous-era**: Time of stars
- **black-hole-era**: Dominated by black holes
- **proton-decay**: Possible baryon dissolution

## Transition

Heat death is the most probable end. But is it the only possibility? Next, we explore alternative endings—scenarios where the universe meets different fates.
