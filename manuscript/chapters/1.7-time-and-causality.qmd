# Time and Causality {#sec-time-causality}

*"Why fast clocks run slow"*

::: {.callout-note}
## Key Revelation
Time is not uniform. High-energy particles experience time more slowly. This is not a relativistic correction—it is fundamental to how the universe works.

## Time Dilation

In this framework, time dilation emerges naturally from the update mechanism.

### The Lag Factor

Each voxel has a local lag factor:

$$
L(x) = 1 + \alpha \cdot E(x) \cdot \omega(x)
$$

Where:
- $\alpha$ = fine structure constant (0.00729)
- $E(x)$ = local energy density
- $\omega(x)$ = local frequency

### The Phase Accumulator

Each tick, the phase accumulator advances:

$$
\tau(x) \leftarrow \tau(x) + \frac{1}{L(x)}
$$

When $\tau \geq 1$, the voxel is "active" and processes updates. Then $\tau$ resets.

**High-energy particles have larger L**, so their τ advances more slowly. They update less frequently. From their perspective, time flows normally—but from an external perspective, they age more slowly.

## Two Particles, Different Times

Consider two particles:

| Particle | Energy | Lag Factor | Updates per 10 ticks |
|----------|--------|------------|---------------------|
| A (low energy) | 1.0 | 1.007 | ~10 |
| B (high energy) | 100.0 | 1.73 | ~6 |

Particle B experiences only 6 "moments" while particle A experiences 10. B ages more slowly.

This is the source of relativistic time dilation in FTD—not a separate effect, but a fundamental feature of how updates propagate. **[SELECTION: the phase accumulator mechanism reproduces relativistic time dilation; its form is chosen to match known physics]**

## Relativistic Mass

As particles approach speed C, their effective mass increases:

$$
m_{\text{relativistic}} = \frac{m_{\text{rest}}}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = m_{\text{rest}} \cdot \gamma
$$

The gamma factor:

$$
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}
$$

As $v \rightarrow c$, $\gamma \rightarrow \infty$. You cannot accelerate a massive particle to the speed of light—the energy required becomes infinite.

## Retarded Positions

Forces don't act instantaneously. Information travels at speed C. When particle A exerts force on particle B, it uses A's position from the past:

$$
\vec{r}_{\text{retarded}} = \vec{r}_{\text{current}} - \vec{v} \cdot \frac{d}{C}
$$

Where $d$ is the distance between particles.

This means:
- Gravity uses past positions
- Electromagnetic forces use past positions
- All causal influence is limited by C

## The Speed Limit

Nothing can travel faster than C (1 voxel per tick). This is not a velocity limit—it is a **causality limit**.

### What Happens at C

When you try to accelerate a particle past C:
1. Energy increases
2. Lag factor increases
3. Particle updates less frequently
4. Effective velocity approaches but never reaches C

### Implementation

```python
speed = |particle.velocity|
if speed > C:
    particle.velocity *= C / speed  # Clamp to C
```

## Experiments

### Twin Paradox
Create two identical particles. Accelerate one to high speed for a journey. Bring it back. Compare their phase accumulators—the traveling twin has aged less.

### Force Lag
Visualize retarded positions. See how forces act on where particles *were*, not where they are now.

### Speed Limit Test
Try to accelerate a particle past C. Watch the relativistic mass increase. See the asymptotic approach to lightspeed.

## Mathematical Details

### Time Dilation Formula

The relationship between proper time τ and coordinate time t:

$$
d\tau = dt \cdot \sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}
$$

In discrete form, this becomes the phase accumulator mechanism.

### Energy-Momentum Relation

$$
E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0 c^2)^2
$$

For a massless particle (like flux waves): $E = pc$

For a massive particle at rest: $E = m_0 c^2$

## Concepts

- **time-dilation**: High energy → slow time
- **phase-accumulator**: The local clock mechanism
- **retarded-positions**: Forces use past data
- **speed-limit**: Nothing exceeds C

## Transition

Time and causality shape how particles move. But what makes them move? Next, we examine the four fundamental forces that govern all interactions.
