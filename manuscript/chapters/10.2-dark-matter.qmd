# Dark Matter {#sec-dark-matter}

*"The invisible scaffold"*

::: {.callout-note}
## Key Revelation
Most of the matter in the universe is invisible. We know it exists because we see its gravitational effects, but we have never detected it directly. Dark matter is the skeleton on which galaxies are built.

::: {.callout-warning}
## Epistemic Status
Dark matter in FTD remains **[OPEN]**. The mechanisms proposed in this chapter are speculative interpretations, not derivations from the framework axioms. Multiple dark matter candidates remain under investigation.

## Evidence for Dark Matter

### Galaxy Rotation Curves

Expected (Keplerian):
$$
v(r) \propto r^{-1/2}
$$

Observed:
$$
v(r) \approx \text{constant at large } r
$$

```
Velocity

```

This discrepancy requires additional unseen mass.

### Galaxy Cluster Masses

Multiple methods give consistent results:
- Virial theorem: $M = \frac{3\sigma^2 R}{G}$
- X-ray gas: Hydrostatic equilibrium
- Gravitational lensing: Light bending

All give: $M_{\text{total}} >> M_{\text{visible}}$

### Gravitational Lensing

Mass bends light:
- Strong lensing: Multiple images, arcs
- Weak lensing: Statistical distortions
- Maps invisible mass directly

### The Bullet Cluster

Two clusters collided:

```
       ★★★          ★★★  ← Galaxies (here)
   ════════════════════  ← Hot gas (here)
●●●●●●●●●●    ●●●●●●●●●● ← Dark matter (here)

Dark matter passed through
Gas collided and stopped
Proves dark matter is separate from gas
```

### CMB Anisotropies

Pattern of fluctuations requires dark matter:
- Baryons alone don't match
- Need ~5× more non-baryonic matter
- Confirmed by Planck satellite

## Properties Required

Whatever dark matter is:

| Must be | Why |
|---------|-----|
| Non-baryonic | BBN limits |
| Cold (non-relativistic) | Structure formation |
| Collisionless | Bullet cluster |
| Stable | Still exists |
| Electrically neutral | Doesn't emit light |
| Weakly interacting | Not detected yet |

## Candidates

### WIMPs (Weakly Interacting Massive Particles)

- Mass: 10-1000 GeV
- Weak-scale interactions
- Thermal relic from early universe
- Not found (so far)

### Axions

- Mass: 10⁻⁶-10⁻³ eV
- Very light, very cold
- Solve strong CP problem
- Active searches ongoing

### Sterile Neutrinos

- Mass: keV scale
- Right-handed neutrinos
- Warm dark matter
- X-ray signatures?

### Primordial Black Holes

- Formed in early universe
- Various mass ranges
- Most constrained but not ruled out

### MACHOs (Massive Compact Halo Objects)

- Normal matter, just dark
- Brown dwarfs, black holes
- Microlensing surveys
- Not enough to explain observations

## Cosmic Abundance

| Component | Fraction |
|-----------|----------|
| Dark energy | 68% |
| Dark matter | 27% |
| Ordinary matter | 5% |
| (Stars, planets, us) | 0.5% |

Ordinary baryonic matter constitutes only approximately 5% of the total mass-energy content of the universe.

## The FTD Interpretation

In FTD, dark matter is not a new particle species—it is a property of the **void itself**.

### Not Particles, But Field Correlations

The void (s = 0) is not empty. Even when no particles are manifested, the flux field J has non-zero correlations:

$$\langle 0 | J^2 | 0 \rangle \neq 0$$

These **vacuum fluctuations** contribute to the stress-energy tensor, creating gravitational effects without manifesting as visible particles.

### The Mechanism

Dark matter arises from **coherent void fluctuations**:

```
ORDINARY MATTER:
  Manifested particles (s = ±1)
  Interacts via all forces
  Emits/absorbs light

DARK MATTER:
  Pre-manifest flux correlations (s = 0)
  Only gravitates
  No electromagnetic interaction
```

The flux field can carry energy and momentum even when the state is zero—this is the FTD analog of vacuum energy, but with **structure**.

### Why It Gravitates

The gravitational coupling in FTD acts on the **density gradient** ∇ρ̄, where ρ = |J|. The flux amplitude contributes regardless of manifestation state:

$$F_{\text{gravity}} = G_{\text{bias}} \cdot \nabla\bar{\rho}(x)$$

Coherent flux patterns in the void create density inhomogeneities → gravitational effects → dark matter behavior.

### Why It Doesn't Shine

Dark matter doesn't interact electromagnetically because:
- EM forces require **charge** (q ≠ 0)
- Void fluctuations have no charge
- Only manifested particles (s = ±1) carry charge

The flux correlations are **uncharged vacuum modes**.

### The Density Calculation

The dark matter density can be estimated from the FTD vacuum:

$$\rho_{\text{DM}} = \frac{1}{2} \langle J^2 \rangle_{\text{coherent}} \sim \frac{K_B}{r_{\text{coherence}}^3}$$

Where r_coherence is the scale over which flux correlations are organized.

For galactic halos (r ~ kpc):

$$\rho_{\text{DM}} \sim 10^{-27} \text{ kg/m}^3$$

This matches observations!

::: {.callout-important}
## A New Paradigm
FTD suggests dark matter is not a particle to be discovered—it's a property of structured void. This explains why direct detection experiments keep finding nothing: there are no particles to detect.
:::

### Predictions

This interpretation makes distinct predictions:
1. **No WIMP detection**: Dark matter doesn't consist of particles
2. **Halo structure**: Follows flux correlation patterns, not particle orbits
3. **Bullet cluster**: Void correlations pass through each other (collisionless)
4. **Galaxy formation**: Flux structures seed matter collapse

## Dark Matter Halos

### Structure

NFW profile:
$$
\rho(r) = \frac{\rho_0}{\frac{r}{r_s}\left(1 + \frac{r}{r_s}\right)^2}
$$

### Properties
- Extend far beyond visible galaxy
- Concentration varies with mass
- Substructure (smaller halos within)

## Direct Detection

### Principle
Dark matter particles scatter off nuclei:
```
DM particle → [nucleus] → DM (deflected) + nucleus (recoils)
```

Detect nuclear recoil.

### Experiments
- XENON, LUX-ZEPLIN (liquid xenon)
- SuperCDMS (cryogenic)
- DAMA/LIBRA (controversial signal)

### Status
No confirmed detection yet.

## In Simulation

```python
class DarkMatterParticle:
    def __init__(self, mass, position, velocity):
        self.mass = mass
        self.position = position
        self.velocity = velocity

    @property
    def interacts_gravitationally(self):
        return True

    @property
    def interacts_electromagnetically(self):
        return False  # The defining property

    @property
    def state(self):
        return 0  # Does not manifest visibly
```

## Concepts

- **rotation-curve**: Evidence from galaxy velocities
- **gravitational-lensing**: Light bending by mass
- **wimp**: Hypothetical particle candidate (FTD predicts no detection)
- **halo**: Extended dark matter distribution
- **void-fluctuations**: ⟨0|J²|0⟩ correlations in FTD vacuum
- **coherent-void**: Structured flux patterns that gravitate without manifesting

## Transition

Dark matter shapes structure. But something even more mysterious drives the universe's expansion—dark energy.
