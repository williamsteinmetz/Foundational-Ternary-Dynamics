# Biological Structures {#sec-biological-structures}

*"Life's building blocks"*

::: {.callout-note}
## Key Revelation
Life builds with the same atoms as rocks and metals, but organizes them into self-replicating, energy-processing, information-storing structures. The architecture of life is molecular.

## How FTD Produces Biological Structure
Biological organization emerges from the same flux dynamics governing all matter:

- **Molecular stability** = flux configurations that minimize local energy (hydrogen bonds, van der Waals)
- **Self-assembly** = entropy-driven flux redistribution toward lower free energy states
- **Information storage** = DNA base pairing as specific flux-mediated hydrogen bond patterns
- **Metabolism** = controlled flux transfer between molecular configurations

Life is organized matter—flux configurations that maintain and replicate themselves against entropic dissipation.

## The Cell Membrane

The boundary between life and non-life.

### Lipid Bilayer

```
    Hydrophilic heads (phosphate)
    ○○○○○○○○○○○○○○○○○○○○
    ||||||||||||||||||||
    ══════════════════════  ← Hydrophobic core
    ||||||||||||||||||||
    ○○○○○○○○○○○○○○○○○○○○

Phospholipids self-assemble.
Inside: Aqueous cytoplasm
Outside: Aqueous environment
```

### Properties
- Selectively permeable
- Fluid (molecules move laterally)
- Self-healing
- 5-10 nm thick

### Membrane Proteins

Embedded in the bilayer:

| Type | Function |
|------|----------|
| Channels | Allow specific ions through |
| Transporters | Move molecules against gradient |
| Receptors | Detect signals |
| Enzymes | Catalyze reactions |

## Cytoskeleton

The internal scaffold of cells.

### Microfilaments (Actin)

```
Diameter: 7 nm
Structure: Two twisted strands
Function:
  - Cell shape
  - Cell movement
  - Muscle contraction
```

### Intermediate Filaments

```
Diameter: 10 nm
Structure: Rope-like
Function:
  - Mechanical strength
  - Nuclear envelope
  - Tissue integrity
```

### Microtubules

```
Diameter: 25 nm
Structure: Hollow tube of tubulin
Function:
  - Transport highways
  - Cell division (spindle)
  - Cilia and flagella
```

## DNA Structure

The information molecule.

### Double Helix

    └─S─P─┘
        ↓
     3' end

P = phosphate
S = sugar (deoxyribose)
A, T, G, C = bases
═ = 2 H-bonds (A-T)
≡ = 3 H-bonds (G-C)
```

### Key Properties
- Antiparallel strands (5'→3', 3'→5')
- 10.5 base pairs per turn
- Major and minor grooves
- 2 nm diameter

## Protein Structure

|-------|-------------|---------------|
| Primary | Amino acid sequence | Covalent bonds |
| Secondary | α-helix, β-sheet | Hydrogen bonds |
| Tertiary | 3D fold | All forces |
| Quaternary | Multiple chains | All forces |

## Organelles

Compartments within cells.

| Organelle | Function | Key Feature |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| Nucleus | DNA storage | Double membrane |
| Mitochondria | ATP production | Own DNA |
| Ribosome | Protein synthesis | RNA + protein |
| ER | Protein processing | Connected to nucleus |
| Golgi | Packaging | Stacked membranes |
| Lysosome | Digestion | Acidic interior |
| Chloroplast | Photosynthesis | Own DNA (plants) |

## Self-Assembly

Biological structures build themselves.

### Principles
1. **Thermodynamic favorability**: Lower free energy
2. **Specific interactions**: Lock and key
3. **Hierarchical**: Small units → larger structures
4. **Dynamic**: Constantly remodeling

### Examples
- Lipids → membranes
- Amino acids → proteins → complexes
- Nucleotides → DNA → chromosomes

## In Simulation

```python
class Membrane:
    def __init__(self, phospholipids):
        self.lipids = phospholipids
        self.proteins = []

    def add_protein(self, protein):
        self.proteins.append(protein)

    def permeability(self, molecule):
        if molecule.is_small and molecule.is_nonpolar:
            return HIGH  # Crosses easily
        elif molecule in self.channel_substrates:
            return MEDIUM  # Channel-mediated
        else:
            return LOW  # Blocked

class Protein:
    def __init__(self, sequence):
        self.primary = sequence
        self.secondary = predict_secondary(sequence)
        self.tertiary = fold(self.secondary)
```

## Experiments

### Membrane Assembly
Add phospholipids to water. Watch vesicles form spontaneously.

### Protein Folding
Create amino acid chain. Watch it fold into functional shape.

### Cell Building
Assemble organelles within membrane. Create minimal cell.

## Concepts

- **lipid-bilayer**: Self-assembled membrane structure
- **cytoskeleton**: Internal cell scaffold
- **protein-folding**: Sequence → structure → function
- **self-assembly**: Spontaneous organization

## Transition

We've explored matter at molecular scales. Now we zoom out dramatically—to planets, where gravity dominates and geology shapes worlds.
