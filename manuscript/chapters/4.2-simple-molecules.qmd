## Key Revelation
Simple molecules—just two or three atoms—make up our atmosphere, our water, and the gases we breathe. Complexity starts small.

## Diatomic Molecules

Two-atom molecules. Many elements exist naturally as diatomics.

### Homonuclear Diatomics

| Molecule | Bond | Length (Å) | Energy (kJ/mol) | Notes |
|----------|------|-----------|-----------------|-------|
| H₂ | Single | 0.74 | 436 | Simplest |
| N₂ | Triple | 1.10 | 946 | Very stable |
| O₂ | Double | 1.21 | 498 | Paramagnetic |
| F₂ | Single | 1.42 | 158 | Weak |
| Cl₂ | Single | 1.99 | 243 | Green gas |

### Nitrogen: The Inert Gas
```
:N≡N:

Triple bond makes N₂ extremely stable.
78% of atmosphere.
Won't react with most substances.
```

### Oxygen: The Reactive Gas
```
·O=O·

Double bond, but with unpaired electrons.
Paramagnetic (attracted to magnets).
Essential for respiration.
```

### Heteronuclear Diatomics

| Molecule | Bond | Length (Å) | Energy (kJ/mol) | Notes |
|----------|------|-----------|-----------------|-------|
| HF | Polar | 0.92 | 570 | Strong H-bond |
| HCl | Polar | 1.27 | 432 | Acid |
| CO | Triple | 1.13 | 1077 | Toxic, very stable |
| NO | 2.5 | 1.15 | 631 | Radical, pollutant |

### Carbon Monoxide: Silent Killer
```
:C≡O:

Isoelectronic with N₂ (same electron count).
Binds to hemoglobin stronger than O₂.
Colorless, odorless—dangerous.
```

## Triatomic Molecules

Three atoms, various geometries.

### Water: The Universal Solvent

```

      O
   104.5°
```

| Property | Value | Significance |
|----------|-------|--------------|
| Geometry | Bent | Polar molecule |
| Bond angle | 104.5° | Less than tetrahedral |
| Polarity | High | Dissolves salts |
| H-bonding | Strong | High boiling point |

### Carbon Dioxide: Linear Greenhouse Gas

```

```

| Property | Value | Significance |
|----------|-------|--------------|
| Geometry | Linear | Nonpolar overall |
| Bonds | Double (both) | Stable |
| Vibration | IR active | Greenhouse effect |

### Ozone: The UV Shield

```
  O       O

    O

```

Three oxygen atoms, bent geometry. Absorbs harmful UV radiation in the stratosphere.

### Other Triatomics

| Molecule | Geometry | Angle | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|-------|
| H₂S | Bent | 92° | Rotten egg smell |
| NO₂ | Bent | 134° | Brown gas, pollutant |
| SO₂ | Bent | 119° | Acid rain precursor |

## Molecular Geometry

### VSEPR Theory

Electron pairs arrange to minimize repulsion:

| Electron pairs | Geometry | Example |
|---------------|----------|---------|
| 2 | Linear | CO₂ |
| 3 | Trigonal planar | BF₃ |
| 4 | Tetrahedral | CH₄ |
| 5 | Trigonal bipyramidal | PCl₅ |
| 6 | Octahedral | SF₆ |

Lone pairs count too, but don't appear in the name.

### Why Water is Bent

Oxygen has 4 electron pairs around it:
- 2 bonding pairs (to H)
- 2 lone pairs

```
       ‥
       O
      / \
     H   H
```

Lone pairs repel more than bonding pairs, compressing the bond angle from 109.5° to 104.5°.

## Polarity

### Molecular Dipole Moment

The vector sum of all bond dipoles.

- **Water**: Bent shape → net dipole → polar
- **CO₂**: Linear shape → dipoles cancel → nonpolar

### Why Polarity Matters

Polar molecules:
- Dissolve in water
- Have higher boiling points
- Participate in hydrogen bonding

## Experiments

### Build Molecules
Construct diatomic and triatomic molecules. See geometries form.

### Measure Bond Properties
Calculate bond lengths, angles, and energies.

### Polarity Visualization
See charge distributions in molecules.

## Concepts

- **diatomic**: Two-atom molecule
- **triatomic**: Three-atom molecule
- **molecular-geometry**: Shape determined by electron pairs
- **molecular-polarity**: Net charge distribution

## Transition

Simple molecules are the letters. Now we build words—complex molecules with multiple functional groups, including the organic chemistry of life.
