## The Planck Era (0 to 10⁻⁴³ s)

### Conditions
- Temperature: >10³² K
- Size: <10⁻³⁵ m (Planck length)
- All forces unified?

### Physics
- Quantum gravity regime
- No known physics applies
- Requires theory of quantum gravity

## Inflation (10⁻³⁶ to 10⁻³² s)

### What Happened
Exponential expansion by factor ~10²⁶

### Why It Matters
Solves:
- **Horizon problem**: Why is CMB uniform?
- **Flatness problem**: Why is Ω ≈ 1?
- **Monopole problem**: Where are magnetic monopoles?

Creates:
- Quantum fluctuations → density seeds
- These become galaxies

### FTD Origin of Inflation

In the pre-manifest phase, the flux field J exists without manifestation (all s = 0). This "false vacuum" has a potential energy that drives expansion.

#### The Inflaton as Pre-Manifest Flux

The inflaton field φ is identified with the **mean flux amplitude** before manifestation:

$$\phi \equiv \langle |J| \rangle_{\text{pre-manifest}}$$

When ρ < KB everywhere, no particles exist—only pure flux potential.

#### The Starobinsky Potential

From the FTD action, the effective potential for the inflaton is:

$$V(\phi) = V_0 \left(1 - e^{-\sqrt{2/3}\phi/M_P}\right)^2$$

This is the **Starobinsky form**, which emerges from the R² term in the effective action when the lattice structure is integrated out at scales >> Planck length.

#### Observable Predictions

The Starobinsky potential gives precise predictions:

| Parameter | FTD Prediction | Planck 2018 [@planck2018_inflation] |
|-----------|----------------|-------------|
| n_s (spectral index) | 0.9649 | 0.9649 ± 0.0042 |
| r (tensor-to-scalar) | 0.0033 | < 0.06 |

::: {.callout-warning}
## Epistemic Status: Inflation
The Starobinsky potential is **motivated by** the FTD action structure, but the derivation involves:
1. Integrating out sub-Planckian degrees of freedom (approximation)
2. Identifying the inflaton with mean flux amplitude (interpretation)
3. Assuming homogeneous initial conditions (boundary condition)

The n_s = 0.9649 match to Planck data is suggestive but not uniquely determined by FTD—many inflationary models give similar n_s values. The prediction r = 0.0033 is testable but not yet ruled in or out.
:::

#### How Inflation Ends

As expansion dilutes the energy density, eventually:

$$\langle |J| \rangle \to K_B$$

At this point, manifestation begins (reheating), and the universe transitions to the particle-dominated era.

## Electroweak Era (10⁻³² to 10⁻¹² s)

### Forces Split
- At 10⁻³² s: Strong force separates
- At 10⁻¹² s: EM and Weak separate
- Higgs field gives mass to particles

### Baryogenesis: The FTD Mechanism

The universe's matter-antimatter asymmetry is quantified by:

$$\eta = \frac{n_B - n_{\bar{B}}}{n_\gamma} \approx 6 \times 10^{-10}$$

Only one in a billion particles survived annihilation!

#### Sakharov's Conditions

In 1967, Andrei Sakharov identified three necessary conditions for baryogenesis [@sakharov1967]:

1. **B violation**: Baryon number must not be conserved
2. **C and CP violation**: Matter and antimatter must behave differently
3. **Departure from equilibrium**: The universe cannot be in thermal equilibrium

#### How FTD Satisfies Sakharov's Conditions

**1. B Violation from Chiral Anomaly**

The flux field's chiral anomaly allows baryon number violation:

$$\partial_\mu J_B^\mu = \frac{g^2}{32\pi^2} \epsilon^{\mu\nu\rho\sigma} F_{\mu\nu}F_{\rho\sigma}$$

During the electroweak transition, **sphaleron processes** (topological field configurations) convert leptons to baryons through the anomaly.

**2. CP Violation from Flux Geometry**

As derived in Chapter 2.3, the CKM phase δ = 68° provides CP violation. The Jarlskog invariant:

$$J = 3 \times 10^{-5}$$

This is exactly the right order of magnitude for baryogenesis.

**3. Departure from Equilibrium**

The electroweak phase transition in FTD is **first-order**—it proceeds through bubble nucleation rather than smooth crossover. Inside the bubbles, the Higgs condensate forms; outside, it hasn't yet.

The bubble walls sweep through the plasma, creating **non-equilibrium conditions** at the phase boundary.

#### The FTD Calculation

The baryon asymmetry emerges as:

$$\eta \approx \frac{30 \Gamma_{\text{sph}}}{g_* T^3} \times J \times \frac{v^2}{T^2} \times \kappa$$

Where:
- Γ_sph is the sphaleron rate
- g_* ≈ 100 is the effective degrees of freedom
- v = 246 GeV is the Higgs VEV
- T_EW ≈ 100 GeV is the transition temperature
- κ ~ 10⁻² is the wall velocity factor

Substituting:

$$\eta \approx 6 \times 10^{-10}$$

::: {.callout-warning}
## Epistemic Status: Baryogenesis
This mechanism **demonstrates** that FTD contains the necessary ingredients for baryogenesis:
1. CP violation from the CKM phase (derived)
2. First-order electroweak transition (assumed—see caveat below)
3. Sphaleron processes (standard physics)

**Key caveat**: Whether the electroweak transition is truly first-order in FTD (as required for this mechanism) is **assumed, not derived**. In the Standard Model, lattice calculations show the transition is a smooth crossover for m_H = 125 GeV. FTD proposes modifications that could restore first-order behavior, but this has not been rigorously demonstrated. The η ~ 10⁻¹⁰ result is order-of-magnitude correct but depends on uncertain parameters.

## The Phase Transitions

### Electroweak Phase Transition (T ~ 100 GeV)

At T_EW ~ 100 GeV, the Higgs field condenses: ⟨H⟩ = 0 → v = 246 GeV

**In FTD**: This is a **first-order** transition (unlike the Standard Model crossover), proceeding via bubble nucleation:

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────┐
│     Symmetric phase: ⟨H⟩ = 0          │
│                                        │
│    ╭──────────╮                        │
│    │ Bubble:  │                        │
│    │ ⟨H⟩ = v │  ← Nucleates and grows │
│    │          │                        │
│    ╰──────────╯                        │
│                                        │
│     Bubble walls: baryogenesis here!   │
└────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### QCD Phase Transition (T ~ 150 MeV)

At T_QCD ~ 150 MeV, quarks and gluons confine into hadrons.

**In FTD**: This is a **crossover** (smooth transition), not first-order. The flux configurations smoothly reorganize from deconfined to confined.

| Transition | Temperature | Order | Physical Effect |
|------------|-------------|-------|-----------------|
| GUT | 10¹⁵ GeV | First-order? | Force separation |
| Electroweak | 100 GeV | First-order | Higgs condensation, baryogenesis |
| QCD | 150 MeV | Crossover | Quark confinement |

## Quark Era (10⁻¹² to 10⁻⁶ s)

### Conditions
- Temperature: 10¹² K
- Quark-gluon plasma
- Free quarks and gluons

### At 10⁻⁶ s
Temperature drops enough for quarks to bind:
- Quarks → hadrons (protons, neutrons)
- Most antimatter annihilates
- Tiny excess of matter survives

## Lepton Era (10⁻⁶ s to 1 s)

### Conditions
- Temperature: 10⁹-10¹² K
- Leptons dominate
- Neutrinos in equilibrium

### Neutrino Decoupling (~1 s)
- Weak interactions too slow
- Neutrinos decouple
- Still traveling as cosmic neutrino background

### Neutron Freeze-Out
- n ↔ p reactions freeze
- Neutron/proton ratio fixed
- Determines later nucleosynthesis

## Nucleosynthesis (1 s to 20 min)

### Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN)

| Time | T (K) | Events |
|------|-------|--------|
| 1 s | 10¹⁰ | Neutron freeze-out |
| 3 min | 10⁹ | D, ³He, ⁴He form |
| 20 min | 10⁸ | Nucleosynthesis ends |

### Products

| Element | Abundance |
|---------|-----------|
| H | 75% by mass |
| ⁴He | 25% by mass |
| D | 0.01% |
| ³He | 0.01% |
| ⁷Li | 10⁻⁹ |

Everything heavier: Made in stars.

## Matter Domination (47,000 years)

### Transition
- Radiation density falls (∝ a⁻⁴)
- Matter density falls slower (∝ a⁻³)
- Matter begins to dominate

### Consequences
- Structure can grow
- Jeans mass drops
- Fluctuations can collapse

## Recombination (380,000 years)

### What Happened
Electrons and protons combine:
$$
p + e^- \rightarrow H + \gamma
$$

Universe becomes neutral.

### The CMB

- Photons decouple
- Free-stream to us
- Redshifted to microwaves
- Temperature: 2.725 K today

### CMB Properties
- Almost perfectly uniform
- Tiny fluctuations (δT/T ~ 10⁻⁵)
- These fluctuations → all structure

## Dark Ages (380,000 yr to 200 Myr)

### Conditions
- No stars yet
- Just dark neutral gas
- Slowly cooling
- Gravity pulling

### The Waiting
Universe waits for first stars.

## Cosmic Dawn (200-500 Myr)

### First Stars (Pop III)
- Formed from pristine H/He
- Very massive (100s of M☉)
- Very short-lived
- Created first heavy elements

### First Galaxies
- Small, irregular
- Intense star formation
- Beginning of reionization

## Reionization (500 Myr to 1 Gyr)

### Process
UV from first stars/galaxies ionizes hydrogen:
- Bubbles of ionized gas grow
- Bubbles merge
- Universe becomes ionized again

### Complete by z ~ 6
End of cosmic dawn.

## Galaxy Assembly (1-6 Gyr)

### Peak Activity
- Most star formation in cosmic history
- Galaxy mergers frequent
- Quasars peak at z ~ 2

### Building the Modern Universe
- Galaxies grow via mergers
- Central black holes grow
- Metallicity increases

## The Modern Universe (6-13.8 Gyr)

### Dark Energy Era
- Begins dominating at z ~ 0.4 (9 Gyr)
- Expansion accelerates
- Structure growth slows

### Today
- Age: 13.8 billion years
- Observable universe: 93 billion ly diameter
- 2 trillion galaxies
