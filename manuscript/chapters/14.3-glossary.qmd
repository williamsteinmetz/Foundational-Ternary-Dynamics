## A

**Accretion**
: The accumulation of matter by gravitational attraction. In FTD, particles clump when density gradients exert net force toward centers.

**Annihilation**
: The collision of matter (+1) and antimatter (-1) particles, both returning to void (0) and releasing their energy as flux waves.

**Anthropic Principle**
: The observation that the universe's constants must permit observers, since we exist to observe them.

**Antimatter**
: State -1 particles. Equivalent to matter in all ways except opposite charge/polarity. Annihilates with matter upon contact.

## B

**b₃ (QCD Beta Coefficient)**
: Framework integer = 7. The first coefficient in the QCD beta function for SU(3). Appears in electron mass (70 = b₃(b₃+N_c)) and gravitational coupling (1/(b₃+N_c)²).

**Baryon**
: A composite particle made of three quarks (triad configuration). Includes protons and neutrons.

**Bell Test**
: Experimental verification of quantum correlations exceeding classical bounds. Measures S parameter (classical ≤2, quantum ≤2√2).

**Big Bang**
: The initial genesis event from which the universe emerged. In FTD, initial flux creates conditions for widespread particle genesis.

**Binding**
: The locking of particles into stable structures (triads, shells). Bound particles resist decay.

**Black Hole**
: A region where density is so high that the escape velocity exceeds C. Particles entering cannot leave.

## C

**C (Speed of Causality)**
: Fundamental constant = 1.0 voxel/tick. The maximum speed at which any influence can propagate. Nothing exceeds C.

**Casimir Effect**
: Attractive force between close surfaces due to excluded vacuum fluctuation modes. Demonstrates reality of zero-point energy.

**Calorimeter**
: Detector measuring particle energy by total absorption. Used in particle physics experiments.

**Chain of Necessity**
: The dependency chain used in this book to organize which results rely on which inputs. Where the text asserts “uniqueness,” it is always meant relative to an explicitly stated constraint class or search space (see the Assumption Ledger).

**Charge**
: A property that determines electromagnetic interaction. In FTD, derived from quark composition (±1/3, ±2/3).

**Complexity**
: Properties of wholes that emerge from but are not present in parts. Arises from interactions between many components.

## D

: The component driving accelerating expansion. In FTD, potentially emergent from vacuum properties.

**Dark Matter**
: Non-luminous matter detected only by gravitational effects. In FTD, potentially particles that interact gravitationally but not electromagnetically.

**Decay**
: The gradual reduction of flux magnitude. Controlled by DECAY_RATE. Bound particles have suppressed decay.

**Density**
: The magnitude of the flux vector: ρ = |J|. Determines genesis probability when above KB.

**Divergence**
: Scalar field measuring flux source/sink at a point. Positive divergence → matter genesis; negative → antimatter.

## E

**Electromagnetism**
: Force between charged particles. Arises from charge gradients in FTD.

**Emergence**
: The appearance of novel properties at higher levels of organization. Atoms have wetness; electrons don't.
