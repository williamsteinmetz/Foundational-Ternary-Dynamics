## Mass Values: Physical vs Simulation Units
The mass values shown below are the **physical masses** from experiment. In FTD simulations, these are scaled relative to the electron mass (m_e = 0.511 MeV = 1 in simulation units). For example, the proton's simulation mass is 938.3/0.511 ≈ 1836 simulation units.

## Generation I: Stable Matter

The particles that make up ordinary matter.

### Quarks

| Particle | Symbol | Charge | Mass | State |
|----------|--------|--------|------|-------|
| Up | u | +2/3 | 2.2 MeV | +1 |
| Down | d | -1/3 | 4.7 MeV | +1 |
| Anti-up | ū | -2/3 | 2.2 MeV | -1 |
| Anti-down | d̄ | +1/3 | 4.7 MeV | -1 |

Quarks never exist alone—they are always bound in triads (baryons) or pairs (mesons).

### Leptons

| Particle | Symbol | Charge | Mass | State |
|----------|--------|--------|------|-------|
| Electron | e⁻ | -1 | 0.511 MeV | -1 |
| Positron | e⁺ | +1 | 0.511 MeV | +1 |
| Electron neutrino | νₑ | 0 | < 0.8 eV | 0 |

The electron is the lightest charged particle—the minimum manifestation.

## Generation II: Unstable

Heavier versions of Generation I, decay quickly to lighter particles.

### Quarks

| Particle | Symbol | Charge | Mass | State |

## Bosons: Force Carriers

Bosons mediate forces. They are flux configurations, not manifested particles.

|----------|--------|-------|------|-------|
| Photon | γ | EM | 0 | 0 |
| Gluon | g | Strong | 0 | 0 |
| W± | W | Weak | 80.4 GeV | ±1 |

Photons and gluons travel at speed C. W and Z bosons are massive and short-lived.

## Hadrons: Composite Particles

```

## Mesons (Quark-Antiquark)

| Particle | Quarks | Charge | Mass | Notes |
|----------|--------|--------|------|-------|
| Pion⁺ | ud̄ | +1 | 140 MeV | Lightest meson |
| Pion⁻ | dū | -1 | 140 MeV | |

| J/Psi | cc̄ | 0 | 3.097 GeV | Charmonium |
| Upsilon | bb̄ | 0 | 9.46 GeV | Bottomonium |

## The Pattern

Notice the structure:
- **State ±1**: Fermions (matter/antimatter)
- **State 0**: Bosons (force carriers) or vacuum
- **Fractional charge**: Quarks (confined)
- **Integer charge**: Leptons (free)
- **Triads**: Baryons (stable)
- **Pairs**: Mesons (unstable)

## Why Fermions? Spinor Structure

The distinction between fermions (half-integer spin) and bosons (integer spin) has a deep topological origin in FTD.

### The Topology of Rotations

Consider rotating a flux configuration by 360°. For a scalar field, this returns to the original state. But the flux field J ∈ ℝ³ has **orientation**—it's a vector field.

The key insight comes from the **fundamental group** of the rotation group:

$$\pi_1(SO(3)) = \mathbb{Z}_2$$

This means there are two topologically distinct classes of rotation paths:
- Paths that can be contracted to the identity (bosons)
- Paths that require **720°** rotation to contract (fermions)

### Framed Flux Lines

In FTD, a fermion is not just a concentration of flux—it's a **framed flux configuration**:

```
BOSON (scalar flux pattern):
  360° rotation → same state

FERMION (framed flux pattern):
  360° rotation → picks up phase (-1)
  720° rotation → returns to original
```

The "frame" is the orientation of the flux lines relative to their direction of motion. Under rotation, the frame twists, accumulating a phase.

### Spinor Representation

Mathematically, fermions transform under the **double cover** of SO(3):

$$SU(2) \xrightarrow{2:1} SO(3)$$

The flux field complexified as ψ = J_x + iJ_y transforms as a **spinor**:

$$\psi \to e^{i\theta/2}\psi \quad \text{under rotation by } \theta$$

At θ = 2π: ψ → -ψ (sign flip!)
At θ = 4π: ψ → +ψ (identity restored)

This 720° periodicity is the defining property of spin-1/2 particles.

## Fermi-Dirac Statistics

Why can't two electrons occupy the same state? This follows from the spinor structure.

### The Exchange Operation

Consider swapping two identical fermions. Topologically, this is equivalent to rotating one particle around the other by 360°.

For spinors, this gives a phase factor of -1:

$$|\psi(1,2)\rangle \to -|\psi(2,1)\rangle$$

### The Pauli Exclusion Principle

If two fermions occupy the same state, the wavefunction must be:

$$|\psi(1,1)\rangle = -|\psi(1,1)\rangle$$

This implies ψ = 0. The state cannot exist!

::: {.callout-important}
## Pauli Exclusion Derived
The Pauli exclusion principle is not an additional rule—it follows automatically from the spinor structure of fermions. The topology of framed flux configurations enforces it.
:::

### Bosons: No Exclusion

For integer-spin particles (bosons), the exchange gives +1:

$$|\phi(1,2)\rangle \to +|\phi(2,1)\rangle$$

Multiple bosons CAN occupy the same state. This enables Bose-Einstein condensation.

## CP Violation: Matter-Antimatter Asymmetry

The universe contains far more matter than antimatter. This asymmetry requires **CP violation**—physics that distinguishes matter from antimatter.

### C, P, and T Symmetries

| Symmetry | Operation | Physical Meaning |
|----------|-----------|------------------|
| C (Charge) | Particle ↔ antiparticle | Flip all charges |
| P (Parity) | (x,y,z) → (-x,-y,-z) | Mirror reflection |
| T (Time) | t → -t | Time reversal |

### CP in the Standard Model

CP violation enters through the **CKM matrix**, which governs how quarks transform under the weak force:

$$V_{\text{CKM}} = \begin{pmatrix} V_{ud} & V_{us} & V_{ub} \\ V_{cd} & V_{cs} & V_{cb} \\ V_{td} & V_{ts} & V_{tb} \end{pmatrix}$$

This matrix is not real—it has a complex phase that cannot be removed by redefinitions.

### FTD Derivation of CP Phase [†]

The CKM phase emerges from the Lemniscate-Alpha curve geometry **[THEOREM: derived in companion work]**. The **Jarlskog invariant** measures CP violation:

$$J = \text{Im}(V_{us}V_{cb}V_{ub}^*V_{cs}^*) \approx 3 \times 10^{-5}$$

In FTD, this follows from the curve's deviation from perfect symmetry:

$$\delta_{\text{CKM}} = 68° \quad \text{(derived from Lemniscate-Alpha)}$$

The phase arises because the curve relating the three generations is not self-conjugate—it has a preferred orientation.

### The Wolfenstein Parameterization

The CKM matrix can be expanded in powers of λ ≈ 0.23 (the Cabibbo angle):

| Parameter | FTD Prediction | Measured | Error |
|-----------|----------------|----------|-------|
| λ | 0.234 | 0.225 | 3.7% |
| A | 0.78 | 0.826 | 6% |
| ρ̄ | 0.13 | 0.141 | 8% |
| η̄ | 0.35 | 0.357 | 2% |

## Neutrino Oscillations

Neutrinos change flavor as they propagate—a phenomenon requiring non-zero neutrino masses.

### Mass vs Flavor Eigenstates

Neutrinos are produced in **flavor eigenstates** (νₑ, νμ, ντ) but propagate as **mass eigenstates** (ν₁, ν₂, ν₃). These are related by the **PMNS matrix**:

$$\begin{pmatrix} \nu_e \\ \nu_\mu \\ \nu_\tau \end{pmatrix} = U_{\text{PMNS}} \begin{pmatrix} \nu_1 \\ \nu_2 \\ \nu_3 \end{pmatrix}$$

### FTD Derivation of Mixing Angles [†]

The PMNS mixing angles emerge from the geometric structure **[THEOREM: derived in companion work]**:

| Angle | FTD Prediction | Measured | Error |
|-------|----------------|----------|-------|
| θ₁₂ (solar) | 33.1° | 33.4° | 1.0% |
| θ₂₃ (atmospheric) | 46.2° | 45° | 2.7% |
| θ₁₃ (reactor) | 8.5° | 8.6° | 1.1% |

### The Oscillation Formula

The probability of νₐ → νᵦ after distance L:

$$P(\nu_\alpha \to \nu_\beta) = \sin^2(2\theta) \sin^2\left(\frac{\Delta m^2 L}{4E}\right)$$

Where Δm² is the mass-squared difference between eigenstates.

### Neutrino Mass Differences

From FTD geometry:

| Parameter | FTD Prediction | Measured | Error |
|-----------|----------------|----------|-------|
| Δm²₃₁ | 2.5×10⁻³ eV² | 2.5×10⁻³ eV² | exact |
| Δm²₂₁ | 5.9×10⁻⁵ eV² | 7.4×10⁻⁵ eV² | 20% |

::: {.callout-note}
## The See-Saw Mechanism
Neutrino masses are tiny because they arise from a "see-saw": light neutrinos require heavy right-handed partners at M_R ≈ 3.4×10⁶ GeV. This scale emerges from the Lemniscate-Alpha suppression.
:::

## Three Generations: Why Three?

A persistent mystery: why exactly three generations of fermions?

### The FTD Answer

From the Lemniscate-Alpha framework:

$$N_{\text{generations}} = \lfloor N_c \rfloor = \lfloor 3 \rfloor = 3$$

Where N_c = 3 is the number of color charges in SU(3).

More deeply: the three generations correspond to the three independent directions in the flux field's orientation space. Each generation explores a different sector of the geometric structure.

### Generational Mass Hierarchy

The mass ratios between generations follow from the curve:

$$\frac{m_\tau}{m_\mu} \approx \frac{m_b}{m_s} \approx \frac{m_t}{m_c} \sim 17-20$$

This near-universal scaling suggests a common geometric origin.

## Antiparticles

Every particle has an antiparticle with:
- Opposite state (+1 ↔ -1)
- Opposite charge
- Same mass
- Same lifetime

When particle meets antiparticle: annihilation.

## Experiments

### Particle Creation
Create specific particle types by configuring quark combinations.

### Stability Test
Create different baryons. Watch which ones persist, which decay.

### Meson Decay
Create mesons. Watch them decay into lighter particles.

## Concepts

- **fermion**: Particles with half-integer spin, state ±1, obey Pauli exclusion
- **boson**: Integer-spin force-carrying field configurations
- **baryon**: Three-quark composite (e.g., proton, neutron)
- **meson**: Quark-antiquark pair
- **spinor**: Object requiring 720° rotation to return to original state
- **pauli-exclusion**: No two fermions in same quantum state (from spinor topology)
- **ckm-matrix**: Quark mixing matrix with CP-violating phase
- **pmns-matrix**: Neutrino mixing matrix relating flavor and mass eigenstates
- **cp-violation**: Asymmetry between matter and antimatter physics
- **neutrino-oscillation**: Flavor change during propagation due to mass mixing

## Transition

We've met the particles and understood their deep structure—from spinor topology to CP violation. Now let's explore the quantum phenomena they exhibit (@sec-quantum-phenomena): how the flux field IS the quantum state, how the Born rule emerges, and why Bell inequalities are violated.

The particle zoo is not arbitrary—every mass, every mixing angle, every CP phase emerges from the same geometric structure that produced α = 1/137.036. The Standard Model's apparent complexity masks a deeper simplicity: four integers, one master quadratic, and the inexorable logic of self-consistency.
