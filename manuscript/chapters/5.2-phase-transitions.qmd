# Phase Transitions {#sec-phase-transitions}

*"When matter transforms"*

::: {.callout-note}
## Key Revelation
Phase transitions happen at specific conditions—the critical points where energy finally overcomes the forces holding a phase together.

## How FTD Produces Phase Transitions
Phase transitions in FTD arise from competition between flux gradients:

- **Binding flux** holds structures together (attractive gradients)
- **Kinetic flux** enables particle motion (momentum distribution)
- **Critical point** occurs when kinetic flux overcomes binding flux
- **Latent heat** = flux energy required to break neighbor correlations

The Clausius-Clapeyron equation emerges from flux balance at phase boundaries.

### Key Points

- **Triple point**: All three phases coexist
- **Critical point**: Liquid-gas distinction vanishes

## Transition Types

| Transition | Direction | Energy |
|------------|-----------|--------|
| Melting | Solid → Liquid | Absorb (ΔH > 0) |
| Freezing | Liquid → Solid | Release (ΔH < 0) |
| Vaporization | Liquid → Gas | Absorb |
| Condensation | Gas → Liquid | Release |
| Sublimation | Solid → Gas | Absorb |
| Deposition | Gas → Solid | Release |
| Ionization | Gas → Plasma | Absorb |
| Recombination | Plasma → Gas | Release |

## Latent Heat

Energy absorbed or released during transition without temperature change.

### Heat of Fusion

Energy to melt solid:
$$
Q = m \times L_f
$$

### Heat of Vaporization

Energy to boil liquid:
$$
Q = m \times L_v
$$

Usually $L_v >> L_f$ because you must completely separate molecules.

## First-Order Transitions

Sharp boundaries, latent heat involved.

### Characteristics
- Discontinuity in first derivative of free energy
- Coexisting phases at transition
- Latent heat required
- Examples: Melting, boiling, sublimation

## Second-Order Transitions

Continuous change, no latent heat.

### Characteristics
- Discontinuity in second derivative of free energy
- No latent heat
- Order parameter changes continuously
- Examples: Ferromagnetic → paramagnetic, superconducting transition

## The Clausius-Clapeyron Equation

Describes the slope of phase boundaries:

$$
\frac{dP}{dT} = \frac{L}{T \Delta V}
$$

Where:
- L = latent heat
- ΔV = volume change

### Water's Anomaly

Ice is less dense than water (ΔV < 0), so melting curve has negative slope. Higher pressure → lower melting point.

## Nucleation

Transitions don't happen uniformly—they start at nucleation sites.

### Homogeneous Nucleation
Random fluctuations create seeds of new phase. Rare.

### Heterogeneous Nucleation
Impurities or surfaces provide sites. Much more common.

### Supercooling/Superheating
Without nucleation sites, matter can exist past transition temperature:
- Supercooled water: Liquid below 0°C
- Superheated liquid: Liquid above boiling point

## Critical Phenomena

Near the critical point:
- Fluctuations become huge
- Properties diverge (critical opalescence)
- No distinction between liquid and gas

Above the critical point: **supercritical fluid**—properties of both liquid and gas.

## Cosmological Phase Transitions

The early universe underwent phase transitions just like water—but at vastly higher temperatures.

### The Electroweak Transition (T ~ 100 GeV)

At T ~ 10¹⁵ K (100 GeV), the Higgs field condensed:

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| ⟨H⟩ = 0 | ⟨H⟩ = 246 GeV |
| W, Z massless | W, Z massive |
| EM and Weak unified | EM and Weak separate |

**In FTD**: This is a **first-order** transition. It proceeds via bubble nucleation—exactly like water boiling, but with the Higgs condensate forming inside bubbles.

The bubble walls are where **baryogenesis** happens (see Chapter 10.4).

### The QCD Transition (T ~ 150 MeV)

At T ~ 10¹² K (150 MeV), quarks and gluons confined into hadrons:

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Quark-gluon plasma | Protons, neutrons, pions |
| Free quarks | Quarks confined in color-neutral combinations |
| χ symmetry intact | χ symmetry spontaneously broken |

**In FTD**: This is a **crossover** (smooth transition), not first-order. The flux configurations reorganize continuously rather than via bubbles.

### Phase Transitions in FTD

All phase transitions in FTD involve the flux field reorganizing:

| Transition | Flux Behavior | Order |
|------------|---------------|-------|
| Melting | Bond flux breaks, particles move freely | First-order |
| Boiling | Complete flux separation | First-order |
| Ferromagnetic | Flux alignments disorder | Second-order |
| Superconducting | Flux pairing (Cooper pairs) | Second-order |
| Electroweak | Higgs condensate forms | First-order |
| QCD | Color confinement | Crossover |

## Universal Physics
The same mathematics describes ice melting and the electroweak transition—both involve an order parameter (flux configuration) changing as temperature crosses a critical value.
:::

## Experiments

### Melting Point
Heat a solid. Watch the transition. Measure temperature during phase change.

### Triple Point
Find conditions where solid, liquid, and gas coexist.

### Critical Point
Approach the critical point. Watch the liquid-gas interface disappear.

## Implementation

```python
def check_phase_transition(particle, neighbors):
    local_temp = average_flux_magnitude(neighbors)
    local_pressure = density(neighbors) * local_temp

    current_phase = particle.phase

    # Check transition conditions
    if current_phase == SOLID:
        if local_temp > melting_point(particle.type):
            particle.phase = LIQUID
            absorb_heat(particle, latent_heat_fusion)

    elif current_phase == LIQUID:
        if local_temp > boiling_point(particle.type):
            particle.phase = GAS
            absorb_heat(particle, latent_heat_vaporization)
```

## Concepts

- **latent-heat**: Energy for phase change without temperature change
- **nucleation**: Starting points for phase transitions
- **triple-point**: Three phases coexist
- **critical-point**: Liquid-gas distinction vanishes
- **electroweak-transition**: First-order at T ~ 100 GeV, Higgs condensation
- **qcd-transition**: Crossover at T ~ 150 MeV, quark confinement
- **order-parameter**: Quantity that changes at transition (flux configuration in FTD)

## Transition

Normal phases cover most conditions. But at extremes, exotic states emerge—superconductors, superfluids, and more in @sec-exotic-states.
