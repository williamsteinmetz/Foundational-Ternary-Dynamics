# Exotic States {#sec-exotic-states}

*"When matter does the impossible"*

::: {.callout-note}
## Key Revelation
At extreme conditions—very cold, very dense, very hot—matter exhibits behaviors that defy everyday intuition. These exotic states reveal quantum mechanics at macroscopic scales.

## How FTD Produces Exotic States
Exotic quantum phases emerge when flux behavior becomes macroscopically coherent:

- **Superconductivity** = Cooper pairs form when flux-mediated attraction overcomes thermal disruption; pairs are bosonic and condense into coherent flux state
- **Superfluidity** = Bose-Einstein condensation of flux into a single macroscopic quantum state
- **Bose-Einstein condensate** = many particles sharing identical flux configuration at T → 0
- **Fermi degeneracy** = Pauli exclusion forces fermion flux into high-momentum states

These states reveal that the flux field, not individual particles, is the fundamental reality.

## Superconductivity

Below a critical temperature, some materials conduct electricity with zero resistance.

### Properties
- Zero electrical resistance
- Meissner effect (expels magnetic fields)
- Persistent currents (flow forever)
- Quantized magnetic flux

### Mechanism (BCS Theory)
- Electrons form Cooper pairs via phonons
- Pairs behave as bosons
- Condense into single quantum state
- No scattering = no resistance

### In Simulation
```python
if temperature < T_critical:
    pair_electrons(nearby_electrons)
    for pair in cooper_pairs:
        pair.resistance = 0
        pair.locked = True
```

### Applications
- MRI machines
- Particle accelerators
- Maglev trains
- Quantum computers

## Superfluidity

Zero viscosity below critical temperature.

### Properties
- Flows without friction
- Climbs container walls
- Quantized vortices
- Second sound (temperature waves)

### Helium-4

At 2.17 K, helium-4 becomes superfluid:
- Two-fluid model: normal + superfluid components
- Lambda transition (specific heat spike)
- Cannot be stirred (vortices quantized)

### In Simulation
```python
if temperature < T_lambda and particle.type == HELIUM_4:
    particle.viscosity = 0
    quantize_angular_momentum(particle)
```

## Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC)

At near-absolute zero, bosons occupy the same quantum state.

### Properties
- Macroscopic quantum coherence
- Matter waves visible
- Interference patterns
- Extremely low temperature (nK)

### Creation
1. Laser cool atoms
2. Trap magnetically
3. Evaporative cooling
4. BEC forms below critical T

### In Simulation
Multiple particles can share the same voxel if:
- They are bosons (integer spin)
- Temperature is near zero
- They have identical quantum states

## Quark-Gluon Plasma

At extreme temperature/density, hadrons dissolve.

### Properties
- Quarks and gluons deconfined
- Nearly perfect fluid (lowest viscosity)
- Existed microseconds after Big Bang
- Created briefly in particle colliders

### Conditions
- Temperature > 2 × 10¹² K
- Energy density > 1 GeV/fm³

### In Simulation
```python
if temperature > DECONFINEMENT_TEMP:
    for hadron in hadrons:
        unlock_triads(hadron)
        release_quarks(hadron)
    # Free quarks and gluons interact directly
```

## Neutron Star Matter

At nuclear densities, matter is mostly neutrons.

### Layers
1. **Outer crust**: Iron lattice + electrons
2. **Inner crust**: Neutron-rich nuclei + neutron drip
3. **Outer core**: Superfluid neutrons + superconducting protons
4. **Inner core**: Unknown—quark matter? strange matter?

### Properties
- Density: 10¹⁴ g/cm³
- Supported by neutron degeneracy pressure
- Intense magnetic fields (10¹² G)
- Millisecond rotation possible

## Degenerate Matter

When quantum pressure prevents further compression.

### Electron Degeneracy
- Supports white dwarfs
- Electrons fill lowest states
- Pauli exclusion prevents collapse
- Limit: 1.4 M☉ (Chandrasekhar)

### Neutron Degeneracy
- Supports neutron stars
- Neutrons fill lowest states
- Limit: ~3 M☉ (uncertain)

## Strange Matter

Hypothetical stable matter containing strange quarks.

### Properties (Theoretical)
- Lower energy than nuclear matter (?)
- Self-stabilizing
- Would convert normal matter on contact
- May exist in neutron star cores

## Experiments

### Superconductor Simulation
Cool material below critical temperature. Watch resistance vanish.

### Superfluid Demo
Cool helium. Watch it climb walls and flow without friction.

### BEC Formation
Cool bosons toward absolute zero. Watch them condense.

## Concepts

- **superconductivity**: Zero electrical resistance
- **superfluidity**: Zero viscosity
- **bose-einstein-condensate**: Bosons in same quantum state
- **quark-gluon-plasma**: Deconfined quarks and gluons

## Transition

Exotic states show matter's quantum nature at large scales. Now we explore how matter organizes—from crystals to semiconductors to biological structures.
