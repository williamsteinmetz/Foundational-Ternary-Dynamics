# Chemical Bonds {#sec-chemical-bonds}

*With stable atoms in hand, we now explore how they combine through electron shell interactions.*

*"How atoms connect"*

::: {.callout-note}
## Key Revelation
Atoms bond to achieve stability. Whether by giving, taking, or sharing electrons, the goal is always the same: complete shells.
:::

## Why Atoms Bond

Atoms are most stable with full outer shells. Most atoms don't have full shells naturally, so they bond with other atoms to share electrons.

## Ionic Bonds

Electron transfer creates oppositely charged ions that attract.

### Example: Sodium Chloride

```
Na → Na⁺ + e⁻     (loses 1 electron)
Cl + e⁻ → Cl⁻     (gains 1 electron)
Na⁺ + Cl⁻ → NaCl  (electrostatic attraction)
```

### Properties of Ionic Compounds
- High melting points (strong electrostatic bonds)
- Brittle crystals (shift and like charges repel)
- Conduct electricity when dissolved (free ions)
- Form regular lattice structures

## Covalent Bonds

Electron sharing between atoms.

### Single Bond
One shared electron pair:
```
H-H: Each H contributes 1 electron
     Both have 2 electrons (full 1s shell)
```

### Double Bond
Two shared pairs:
```
O=O: Each O contributes 2 electrons
     Both have 8 valence electrons
```

### Triple Bond
Three shared pairs:
```
N≡N: Each N contributes 3 electrons
     Very strong, very stable (atmosphere)
```

### Bond Strength
Triple > Double > Single

The more electrons shared, the stronger and shorter the bond.

## Polar vs Nonpolar Covalent

### Nonpolar Covalent
Equal sharing between identical atoms:
```
H-H, O=O, N≡N
```

### Polar Covalent
Unequal sharing between different atoms:
```
H-Cl: Chlorine pulls electrons more strongly
      Creates partial charges: Hδ⁺-Clδ⁻
```

### Electronegativity
The tendency to attract electrons. Fluorine is highest (4.0).

Electronegativity difference determines bond type:
- 0-0.4: Nonpolar covalent
- 0.4-1.7: Polar covalent
- >1.7: Ionic

## Metallic Bonds

Electron "sea" shared among many nuclei.

### Model
```
⊕ e⁻ ⊕ e⁻ ⊕ e⁻ ⊕
e⁻ ⊕ e⁻ ⊕ e⁻ ⊕ e⁻
⊕ e⁻ ⊕ e⁻ ⊕ e⁻ ⊕

⊕ = metal cation
e⁻ = delocalized electron
```

### Properties of Metals
- Electrical conductivity (electrons move freely)
- Thermal conductivity (electrons carry heat)
- Malleability (layers slide without breaking bonds)
- Metallic luster (electrons reflect light)

## Hydrogen Bonds

Weak bonds between molecules, crucial for life.

### Formation
When H is bonded to N, O, or F (electronegative atoms):
```
H-O-H ··· H-O-H
         ↑
    Hydrogen bond
```

### Strength
About 5% of a covalent bond. Weak individually, but significant collectively.

### Importance
- Water's high boiling point
- DNA double helix structure
- Protein secondary structure
- Ice floating (unusual—lower density solid)

## Van der Waals Forces

Weakest intermolecular forces.

### London Dispersion
Temporary dipoles from electron fluctuations. Present in ALL molecules.

### Dipole-Dipole
Permanent dipoles attract each other.

### Dipole-Induced Dipole
Permanent dipole induces temporary dipole in neighbor.

## Experiments

### Bond Formation
Bring atoms together. Watch electrons redistribute. See bonds form.

### Bond Breaking
Add energy to bonds. Watch them break. Measure bond energies.

### Crystal Building
Stack ions or atoms. Watch different bonding types create different structures.

## Concepts
