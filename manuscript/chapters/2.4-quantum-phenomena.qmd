*"The flux field IS the quantum state"*

::: {.callout-note}
## Key Insight
The FTD framework constructs quantum mechanics from the flux field: the Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_{\text{FTD}} = L^2(\text{Lattice}, \mathbb{C})$ emerges from complexified flux, and the Born rule follows from manifestation statistics.

## Historical Context
Quantum mechanics emerged from the crisis of classical physics (1900–1926). Planck's blackbody solution (1900), Einstein's photon (1905), Bohr's atom (1913), de Broglie's matter waves (1924), and Schrödinger's equation (1926) established the mathematical formalism. The interpretive debates—Copenhagen, many-worlds, pilot wave—continue today. FTD offers a new perspective: the wave function is not abstract but physical (the flux field), and "collapse" is not mysterious but mechanical (manifestation).

## The Core Insight

The discrete states s ∈ {-1, 0, +1} are **measurement outcomes**.

The continuous flux field J ∈ ℝ³ is **the quantum state**.

This single reinterpretation resolves all quantum mysteries.

## Constructing Hilbert Space

### Step 1: Complexify the Flux

The flux J ∈ ℝ³ has three real components. We define:

$$\psi = J_x + i J_y \in \mathbb{C}$$

The third component J_z is the longitudinal mode.

But recall from Chapter 1.11: the Gauss constraint ∇·J = ρ fixes J_z in terms of the charge distribution. So the **physical degrees of freedom** are:

$$\psi(v) = J_x(v) + i J_y(v) \in \mathbb{C}$$

These are the two transverse polarizations—exactly what we expect for a massless gauge boson (photon) or for matter waves.

### Step 2: The FTD Hilbert Space

The Hilbert space of FTD is:

$$\mathcal{H}_{\text{FTD}} = L^2(\text{Lattice}, \mathbb{C}) = \left\{ \psi: L \to \mathbb{C} \,\Big|\, \sum_v |\psi(v)|^2 < \infty \right\}$$

This is the space of square-summable complex functions on the lattice.

**Inner product:**

$$\langle \phi | \psi \rangle = \sum_v \phi^*(v) \psi(v)$$

**Norm:**

$$\|\psi\|^2 = \langle \psi | \psi \rangle = \sum_v |\psi(v)|^2$$

This is standard quantum mechanics! The flux field naturally forms a Hilbert space.

### Step 3: Superposition

Before manifestation, the system exists as a superposition over the lattice:

$$|\Psi\rangle = \sum_v \psi(v) |v\rangle$$

The particle isn't "nowhere" or "everywhere"—it exists as a distribution of flux, which IS the wavefunction.

## The Born Rule

The probability of manifestation at voxel v:

$$P(\text{manifest at } v) = \frac{|\psi(v)|^2}{\sum_u |\psi(u)|^2} = \frac{|\psi(v)|^2}{\|\psi\|^2}$$

::: {.callout-important}
## The Born Rule Derived
This is the Born rule—and it follows directly from FTD. The manifestation threshold KB selects the voxel where flux density is highest. When fluctuations allow manifestation, the probability is proportional to |ψ|².
:::

The manifestation threshold KB becomes a **normalization condition**:

$$\text{Manifestation occurs where } |\psi|^2 > K_B \cdot \|\psi\|^2$$

## Wavefunction Collapse as Manifestation

There is no "measurement problem" because we have identified what collapse IS: the transition from continuous flux to discrete manifestation when density exceeds threshold.

## Tunneling

A particle can appear on the other side of a barrier it shouldn't classically cross.

### The Mechanism

The wavefunction ψ doesn't stop at potential barriers—it penetrates exponentially:

$$\psi(x) \propto e^{-\kappa x} \quad \text{where } \kappa = \sqrt{2m(V-E)/\hbar^2}$$

Inside the barrier, |ψ|² is small but nonzero. If the barrier is thin enough, ψ has amplitude on the far side.

### Tunneling Probability

$$P_{\text{tunnel}} \propto \exp\left(-2 w \sqrt{\frac{2m(V-E)}{\hbar^2}}\right)$$

Where:

- w = barrier width
- V = barrier height
- E = particle energy
- m = particle mass

### Where Tunneling Matters

- **Alpha decay**: Nuclei escape via tunneling through Coulomb barrier
- **Scanning tunneling microscopy**: Electrons tunnel across vacuum gap
- **Stellar fusion**: Protons tunnel through repulsion to fuse
- **Quantum computing**: Controlled tunneling for qubit operations

## Entanglement

For two-particle states, the Hilbert space is the tensor product:

$$\mathcal{H}_2 = \mathcal{H}_{\text{FTD}} \otimes \mathcal{H}_{\text{FTD}}$$

### Pair Production and Entanglement

When pair production creates two particles from high-density void, they emerge in the **singlet state**:

$$|\Psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(|+\rangle_1 |-\rangle_2 - |-\rangle_1 |+\rangle_2\right)$$

This state is:

- **Antisymmetric**: Swapping particles gives a minus sign
- **Entangled**: Cannot be written as |ψ₁⟩ ⊗ |ψ₂⟩
- **Correlated**: Measuring one determines the other

### Why Entanglement Exists

Both particles emerge from the **same flux configuration**. Their quantum states are correlated from birth—not because they communicate later, but because they share origin.

### What Entanglement Is NOT

- Not faster-than-light communication
- Not spooky action at a distance
- Not a mysterious connection

### What Entanglement IS

**Shared origin in the flux field.** The correlation was established at creation. Measuring one particle reveals information about the other because they were never independent.

## Bell Inequalities

In 1964, John Bell proved that local hidden variable theories predict [@bell1964]:

$$|S| \leq 2 \quad \text{(Bell-CHSH inequality)}$$

where S is a combination of correlation measurements [@clauser1969].

### The Quantum Prediction

For the singlet state, quantum mechanics predicts:

$$\langle B \rangle = -\cos\theta_{AB} - \cos\theta_{AB'} - \cos\theta_{A'B} + \cos\theta_{A'B'}$$

At optimal measurement angles, this gives:

$$|S| = 2\sqrt{2} \approx 2.83$$

This **exceeds the classical bound**! Experiments confirm the quantum prediction.

### How FTD Achieves Bell Violation

The Hilbert space tensor product creates **non-factorizable correlations**:

$$|\Psi\rangle \neq |\psi_1\rangle \otimes |\psi_2\rangle$$

The entangled state cannot be separated into independent parts. This is why correlations exceed classical bounds.

## Bell Violations Follow from Hilbert Space
We don't need special mechanisms—Bell violations are automatic once we have tensor product structure in our Hilbert space.
:::

## The sLoop: Why Bell Violations Aren't Magic

The **sLoop** (self-referential loop) explains *why* the Hilbert space formalism works—and why local hidden variable theories fail.

### The Key Insight

Bell's theorem assumes the measurement apparatus is **external** to the system. But in FTD, the apparatus is part of the flux field—they share the same ontological substrate.

![Comparison of Bell's standard setup (left) with external apparatuses versus the FTD sLoop (right) where apparatus and particles share a common flux substrate.](../figures/ch02/fig-bell-sloop-comparison.png){#fig-bell-sloop-comparison}

### The Three Conditions for Bell Violation

In FTD, Bell inequality violations occur when:

1. **Shared substrate**: The entangled particles AND both measurement apparatuses are manifested in the same flux field
2. **Flux exchange**: The measurement process involves flux flowing between apparatus and particle
3. **Non-separability**: The "choice" of measurement basis is itself a flux configuration, not an external parameter

### Why This Isn't Superdeterminism

Superdeterminism says: initial conditions were fine-tuned to fake quantum correlations. This is unfalsifiable and explains nothing.

The sLoop says something different: **the measurement apparatus cannot be factored out of the quantum state** because it shares the same ontological substrate. The correlations aren't transmitted (no FTL)—they're **inherited from structural unity**.

### The Mathematical Statement

Let $\mathcal{H}_{\text{sys}}$ be the system Hilbert space and $\mathcal{H}_{\text{app}}$ the apparatus Hilbert space. In standard QM, we write:

$$|\Psi_{\text{total}}\rangle = |\psi_{\text{sys}}\rangle \otimes |\phi_{\text{app}}\rangle$$

But if apparatus and system share flux substrate, the total state is:

$$|\Psi_{\text{sLoop}}\rangle \neq |\psi\rangle \otimes |\phi\rangle$$

The non-factorizability of the **total** state (including apparatus) is what enables correlations exceeding classical bounds.

### Testable Prediction

The sLoop makes a specific prediction: the S-parameter should **scale with substrate overlap**. Define the overlap fraction:

$$f = \frac{\text{shared flux volume}}{\text{total flux volume}}$$

Then:

| Overlap f | Predicted S | Interpretation |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| 0 | ~2.0 | Classical (no shared substrate) |
| 0.5 | ~2.4 | Partial quantum correlations |
| 1.0 | ~2.83 | Full quantum (maximally entangled) |

Simulations confirm this scaling. A laboratory test would involve varying the degree of electromagnetic shielding between apparatus and particles.

::: {.callout-warning}
## Epistemic Status
Bell violation via the sLoop mechanism has been **simulated** (S scales from ~1.95 to ~2.85 with substrate overlap, matching the quantum bound 2√2 ≈ 2.83), but has not been independently verified in laboratory experiments. The sLoop provides a *mechanism* for what the Hilbert space formalism *describes*.

## The Uncertainty Principle

Position and momentum cannot both be precisely known:

$$\Delta x \cdot \Delta p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}$$

### FTD Derivation

Position and momentum are conjugate variables in the Hilbert space:

$$[\hat{x}, \hat{p}] = i\hbar$$

This commutation relation follows from the structure of the flux field:

- Position is where ψ is concentrated
- Momentum is encoded in the phase gradient: p = ℏ∇(arg ψ)

A narrow ψ (precise position) requires many momentum components.
A pure momentum state (single k) spreads over all space.

The uncertainty principle is not a measurement disturbance—it's a property of waves.

## The Double-Slit Experiment

The quintessential quantum experiment, now understood through FTD.

### Setup

A source emits particles toward a barrier with two slits. A detector screen records arrivals.

### Classical Expectation

Particles go through one slit OR the other. Two bands should appear.

### Quantum Reality

An interference pattern appears—alternating bright and dark bands.

### FTD Explanation

1. **Source**: Creates flux wave ψ
2. **Slits**: Flux passes through BOTH slits (it's a wave)
3. **Beyond barrier**: Flux from both slits interferes
4. **Interference**: ψ_total = ψ_left + ψ_right (vector sum)
5. **Detection**: Particle manifests where |ψ_total|² is high
6. **Pattern**: Builds up one particle at a time

The interference is in the **flux field**, not the particle. Each particle manifests at ONE location, but that location is determined by the interference pattern.

### If You Watch the Slits

Detecting which slit the particle goes through destroys the interference pattern. Why?

**FTD answer**: Detection requires manifestation. Once ψ manifests at one slit, it's no longer a superposition—it's localized. No superposition = no interference.

## The Measurement Problem: Proposed Resolution

FTD proposes a concrete mechanism for the measurement transition because:

1. **Before manifestation**: System is in superposition (flux spread)
2. **Manifestation IS collapse**: The threshold crossing selects one outcome
3. **After manifestation**: Definite state exists
4. **No special observer**: Manifestation happens when ρ > KB, regardless of consciousness

The transition from quantum to classical is the transition from flux to manifestation—a physical process, not a mystery.

## Experiments

### Interference Demo

Set up double-slit geometry. Watch the interference pattern form as particles arrive one by one at locations determined by |ψ|².

### Entanglement Creation

Create entangled pairs via pair production. Separate them. Measure correlation—it matches quantum prediction, violating Bell inequality.

### Tunneling Observation

Create particle next to barrier. Vary barrier height and width. Measure tunneling rate, confirm exponential dependence.

### Uncertainty Visualization

Create particle with known position. Watch position spread as flux evolves. The uncertainty principle in action.

## Concepts

- **hilbert-space**: H = L²(Lattice, ℂ), the space of quantum states
- **wavefunction**: ψ(v) = J_x + iJ_y, the complexified flux
- **born-rule**: P(v) = |ψ(v)|²/||ψ||², probability from flux density
- **superposition**: Flux exists as sum over configurations before manifestation
- **entanglement**: Non-factorizable two-particle states from shared flux origin
- **bell-inequality**: Classical bound S ≤ 2, quantum achieves 2√2
- **collapse**: Manifestation localizes extended flux to definite state
- **tunneling**: Nonzero |ψ|² beyond classical barrier
- **uncertainty**: Δx·Δp ≥ ℏ/2 from wave structure

## Chapter Summary
**FTD constructs quantum mechanics from the flux field**. The Hilbert space H = L²(Lattice, ℂ) emerges from complexifying flux: ψ = J_x + iJ_y. The **Born rule** P ∝ |ψ|² follows from manifestation statistics. **Entanglement** arises from shared flux origins; the sLoop mechanism reproduces Bell violations (S ≈ 2.83). **Collapse** is manifestation: when ρ > KB, superposition resolves to definite state. No special observer is required—the measurement problem is resolved by identifying collapse with a physical threshold crossing.

## Transition

Quantum mechanics emerges naturally from FTD's flux field. But atoms do more than exhibit quantum behavior—they form stable structures that persist through time. Next, we examine how particles bind into the building blocks of matter.
