# Gravity Wells {#sec-gravity-wells}

*Having understood how matter organizes from atoms through materials, we now scale up to planetary bodies where gravity dominates.*

*"How worlds are born"*

## Key Revelation
Planets form from the same process that governs all scales: matter following gravity gradients, accumulating until stable structures emerge.

## Planetary Formation

### Stage 1: Accretion

From a disk of gas and dust around a young star:

```
    ★
   ╱|╲
  ╱ | ╲
 ○──○──○  ← Dust grains collide
  ╲ | ╱
   ╲|╱

Dust grains collide and stick.
Electrostatic forces hold small grains.
```

### Stage 2: Planetesimals

When objects reach ~1 km:

- Gravity becomes significant
- Runaway growth begins
- Larger objects attract more material
- Planetesimals form in ~10,000 years

### Stage 3: Protoplanets

- Planetesimals collide and merge
- Mars-sized bodies form
- Oligarchic growth (few dominant)
- Takes ~100,000 years

### Stage 4: Final Assembly

- Giant impacts reshape worlds
- Moon-forming impact (Earth)
- Orbital clearing
- Takes ~100 million years

## The Gravity Well

Planets sit in gravitational potential wells:

| Earth | 11.2 km/s |
| Jupiter | 60 km/s |
| Sun | 618 km/s |

## General Relativity: Emergence from FTD

In FTD, gravity is a force arising from density gradients:

$$\vec{F}_g = G_{\text{bias}} \cdot \nabla\bar{\rho}(x)$$

But general relativity describes gravity as spacetime curvature. How do these connect?

### The Effective Metric

The flux density field ρ(x) creates an **effective metric**:

$$g_{\mu\nu} = \eta_{\mu\nu} + h_{\mu\nu}(\rho)$$

Where:
- η_μν is the flat Minkowski metric
- h_μν is the perturbation from flux density

In the weak-field limit:

$$h_{00} = -\frac{2\Phi}{c^2}, \quad h_{ij} = -\frac{2\Phi}{c^2}\delta_{ij}$$

Where Φ is the Newtonian potential, related to flux density by:

$$\nabla^2\Phi = 4\pi G \rho$$

### Geodesic Motion

Free particles in FTD follow **flux gradients**. In the GR picture, this is **geodesic motion**:

$$\frac{d^2x^\mu}{d\tau^2} + \Gamma^\mu_{\nu\lambda}\frac{dx^\nu}{d\tau}\frac{dx^\lambda}{d\tau} = 0$$

The Christoffel symbols Γ are determined by the metric derivatives—which come from the flux density profile.

## Gravity as Geometry
FTD's flux gradients create an effective curved geometry. What looks like a force is actually motion along the straightest possible path (geodesic) in curved spacetime.
:::

### Einstein's Equations

The linearized Einstein equations:

$$\Box h_{\mu\nu} = -16\pi G T_{\mu\nu}$$

emerge from the FTD wave equation for the flux field:

$$\partial_t^2 J = c^2 \nabla^2 J + \text{sources}$$

The stress-energy tensor T_μν corresponds to the flux density and momentum distributions.

### Beyond Linearized Gravity

At higher flux densities (strong gravity), nonlinear effects appear:
- Metric perturbations interact with each other
- Geodesic deviation becomes significant
- Full Einstein equations emerge

This is why FTD naturally incorporates:
- Gravitational waves (flux ripples)
- Black holes (extreme flux concentrations)
- Cosmological expansion (large-scale flux dynamics)

### Gravitational Waves in FTD

When massive objects accelerate, flux patterns propagate outward:

$$h_{+,\times} \propto \frac{1}{r}\frac{d^2Q_{ij}}{dt^2}$$

These are gravitational waves—transverse ripples in the flux field traveling at speed C.

## Differentiation

Heavy elements sink, light elements float.

### Earth's Layers

| Layer | Depth | Composition |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| Crust | 0-35 km | Silicates |
| Mantle | 35-2900 km | Mg, Fe silicates |
| Outer core | 2900-5100 km | Liquid Fe-Ni |
| Inner core | 5100-6371 km | Solid Fe-Ni |

### Heat Sources

- Gravitational compression
- Radioactive decay (U, Th, K)
- Residual accretion heat
- Tidal heating (moons)

## In Simulation

```python
def planetary_formation(dust_cloud):
    while not stable(dust_cloud):
        # Gravity pulls particles together
        apply_gravity(dust_cloud)

        # Detect forming clumps
        clumps = find_density_peaks(dust_cloud)

        # Merge nearby clumps
        for clump in clumps:
            if touching(clump, other_clump):
                merge(clump, other_clump)

        # Check for differentiation
        for planet in large_clumps:
            if hot_enough(planet):
                differentiate(planet)
```

## Concepts

- **accretion**: Growth by gravitational accumulation
- **differentiation**: Separation into layers by density
- **escape-velocity**: Speed to leave gravity well
- **protoplanet**: Forming planet
- **effective-metric**: g_μν = η_μν + h_μν(ρ) from flux density
- **geodesic-motion**: Free particles follow straightest paths in curved spacetime
- **linearized-gr**: □h_μν = -16πGT_μν from FTD wave equation

## Transition

Planets need more than solid ground. Next, we explore atmospheres—the gases that surround worlds and enable life.
