# The First Division {#sec-first-division}

*"0 → +1, -1"*

## Key Insight
Within the framework, manifestation occurs in particle-antiparticle pairs, ensuring global charge conservation. Net state remains zero.

## Genesis

When flux density exceeds the threshold $K_B$ (the manifestation threshold, corresponding to the electron mass scale in natural units) and probability conditions are met, pair production occurs.

For every particle of matter (+1) that manifests, a particle of antimatter (-1) must also appear. This is not a rule imposed from outside; it is a mathematical necessity **[THEOREM: follows from Noether's theorem applied to the action's global symmetry]**. The sum must remain zero.

## The Genesis Event

The moment of creation follows precise rules:

$$
p_{\text{create}}(x) = \text{clamp}\left(1 - \exp\left(-\frac{E(x) - K_B}{K_B}\right), 0, 1\right)
$$

where:

- $p_{\text{create}}(x)$ is the probability of manifestation at position $x$
- $E(x) = |\mathbf{J}(x)|$ is the local flux density (energy proxy)
- $K_B = 0.511$ is the manifestation threshold (electron mass scale)
- $\text{clamp}(y, 0, 1)$ restricts $y$ to the interval $[0, 1]$

When $E(x) \geq K_B$, genesis becomes possible, with probability increasing exponentially above threshold.

### What Happens at Genesis

1. **Flux accumulates** — Energy density builds in a region of space
2. **Threshold reached** — When density ≥ KB, manifestation becomes possible
3. **Pair production** — Matter (+1) and antimatter (-1) emerge together
4. **Momentum conserved** — The pair carries the flux that created them
5. **Entanglement established** — The pair shares a common origin (UUID)

## The Balance Sheet

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| E = energy | E = energy |
| State = 0 | States = +1, -1 |
| Net = 0 | Net = +1 + (-1) = 0 |

Conservation laws are satisfied: energy is conserved, charge is conserved, and the net state remains zero.

## Pair Production

When genesis occurs:

```
0 + Energy → (+1) + (-1)

The Void + sufficient flux → matter + antimatter
```

This is not creation from nothing. This is *reorganization* of what already existed as potential into what now exists as manifestation.

### Properties of the Pair

- **Opposite states**: +1 and -1
- **Shared origin**: Same `entanglement_partner_uuid`
- **Conserved momentum**: Flux divided between them
- **Correlated properties**: Spin, charge, identity linked

## Experiments

### Trigger Genesis
Accumulate flux in a region until particles appear. Watch the threshold behavior—nothing happens until KB is exceeded, then sudden manifestation.

### Balance Check
Count matter vs antimatter in any region. Over sufficient time and space, they are always equal.

### Threshold Discovery
Find the minimum energy for genesis. Probe the boundary at KB = 0.511.

## Mathematical Details

### Energy Threshold
The existence threshold KB = 0.511 corresponds to the electron rest mass in our unit system. Nothing can manifest with less energy than this.

### Probability Function
The exponential form ensures:
- Below threshold: p = 0
- At threshold: p begins rising
- Far above threshold: p → 1

### Divergence Sign

When genesis occurs, the sign of the divergence of the flux field determines which particle gets which state **[SELECTION: follows from the coupling term in the action]**:
- Positive divergence → +1 (matter)
- Negative divergence → -1 (antimatter)

## Concepts

- **genesis**: The transition from State 0 to States ±1
- **three-states**: The fundamental triad (0, +1, -1)
- **pair-production**: Why particles always come in pairs
- **conservation**: The universe's balance sheet

## Transition

The first division has occurred. Now we must understand the two layers of reality—the potential that underlies all, and the manifestation that we observe.
