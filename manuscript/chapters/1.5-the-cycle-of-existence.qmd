# The Cycle of Existence {#sec-cycle}

*"Birth, life, death, return"*

::: {.callout-note}
## Key Insight
Manifestation follows a cyclic pattern: genesis (0 → ±1), persistence, and evaporation (±1 → 0). Conservation laws govern all transitions.
:::

## The Eternal Cycle

```
       0 → ±1 → 0

The Void births existence.
Existence persists while it can.
Existence returns to the Void.
```

This cycle operates at every scale:
- **Particles**: Genesis → Decay
- **Stars**: Nebula → Remnant
- **Galaxies**: Formation → Dissolution
- **Universe**: Big Bang → Heat Death

## Genesis (0 → ±1)

When conditions are right, the Void manifests:

1. **Density threshold**: When flux density ≥ KB
2. **Probability check**: Genesis probability evaluated
3. **Pair production**: Matter (+1) and antimatter (-1) emerge
4. **Identity assignment**: UUID assigned for tracking
5. **Entanglement established**: Partners linked

## Entanglement

Particles born together share a bond. Their `entanglement_partner_uuid` connects them through their shared origin.

This is not "spooky action at a distance"—it is **shared origin**. The correlation exists because they were born together, not because they communicate.

## Persistence (±1 → ±1)

Once manifested, a particle persists by:

1. **Maintaining flux**: Energy above KB
2. **Forming structures**: Stable geometries resist decay
3. **Avoiding annihilation**: Staying away from opposite-state particles

### Forces During Persistence

Manifested particles experience:
- Gravity (density gradients)
- Electromagnetism (charge interactions)
- Strong force (nuclear binding)
- Weak force (transmutation)

## Entropy and Decay

Nothing lasts forever. Every tick, unlocked particles experience decay:

```python
flux *= (1 - DECAY_RATE)  # DECAY_RATE = 0.00729
```

This slow erosion eventually brings all things back to the threshold.

### Decay Suppression

Bound particles (in stable structures like triads) have their decay suppressed:
- **Locked** particles don't decay
- Binding energy stabilizes against entropy
- Structures can persist indefinitely

## Evaporation (±1 → 0)

When density falls below KB:

1. State becomes 0
2. Particle "evaporates" back to Void
3. Flux remains as vacuum energy
4. UUID released

This is not destruction—it is **return**. The energy persists; only the manifestation ends.

## Annihilation (+1 meets -1)

When matter encounters antimatter:

1. Both particles return to Void
2. Energy released as directional flux burst
3. Momentum conserved in the burst
4. Net state returns to zero

```
(+1) + (-1) → energy burst → 0

What was created together returns together.
```

## The Complete Cycle

| Stage | From | To | Trigger |
|-------|------|-----|---------|
| Genesis | 0 | ±1 | Density ≥ KB |
| Persistence | ±1 | ±1 | Energy maintained |
| Decay | ±1 | ±1 | Entropy reduces flux |
| Evaporation | ±1 | 0 | Density < KB |
| Annihilation | +1,-1 | 0 | Opposite states meet |

## The Variational Origin

Why these rules? Why this cycle? The answer comes from the **action principle** (Chapter 1.11).

### Genesis Probability: Derived

The genesis probability is not assumed—it follows from extremizing the action.

The manifestation potential in the Lagrangian:

$$V(\rho, s) = -K_B \ln(\rho/K_B) \quad \text{when } \rho \geq K_B, s = 0$$

creates a pressure toward manifestation when flux density exceeds threshold.

The probability of transition follows from thermal/quantum fluctuations around the action minimum:

$$P(0 \to \pm 1) \propto \exp\left(-\frac{K_B - |J|}{K_B}\right)$$

## Derivation, Not Assumption
The exponential form of genesis probability emerges from the action principle. We didn't put it in by hand—it follows from the mathematics of extremization.
:::

### Polarity Selection: Derived

Why does positive divergence create matter (+1) and negative divergence create antimatter (-1)?

The state-flux coupling term in the action:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{coupling}} = -g \cdot s \cdot (\nabla \cdot J)$$

When minimizing S, the favored state is:

$$s = \text{sign}(\nabla \cdot J)$$

Sources (positive divergence) favor positive states.
Sinks (negative divergence) favor negative states.

### Decay Rate: Derived

The decay rate α ≈ 1/137 comes from the **dissipation function**:

$$\mathcal{F} = \frac{1}{2}\gamma |\partial_t J|^2$$

This modifies the Euler-Lagrange equation to include damping:

$$J(t+1) = (1-\gamma) J(t) + w(t+1)$$

The decay rate γ = α connects to electromagnetic radiation: excited systems lose energy by radiating flux. The fine structure constant measures this coupling. **[IMPOSED: the identification γ = α is a parameter choice, not a derivation—see Assumption Ledger ASSUMP.6]**

### The Complete Derivation

| Rule | Origin in Action |
|------|------------------|
| Genesis probability | Extremization of V(ρ,s) |
| Polarity selection | Coupling term L_coupling |
| Decay rate | Dissipation function F |
| Threshold KB | Manifestation potential minimum |
| Conservation laws | Noether's theorem from symmetries |

The cycle of existence is not arbitrary—it can be represented as a stationary-path solution (δS = 0) for an appropriately chosen action.

## Experiments

### Lifecycle Watch
Create a particle and follow it from genesis through decay to evaporation. Time how long it persists.

### Decay Rate Control
Adjust DECAY_RATE. See how faster decay shortens particle lifetimes, how slower decay extends them.

### Annihilation Setup
Bring a +1 and -1 particle together. Watch the flash of energy as they return to the Void.

## Concepts

- **persistence**: How particles maintain existence
- **decay**: Entropy's erosion of manifestation
- **evaporation**: Return to Void when E < KB
- **annihilation**: Matter + antimatter → energy → Void

## Transition

The cycle of existence requires time. But how does time itself work in this discrete universe? Next, we examine the causal loop—the heartbeat of existence.
