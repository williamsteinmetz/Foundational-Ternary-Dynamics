# The Milky Way {#sec-milky-way}

*"Our cosmic home"*

::: {.callout-note}
## Key Revelation
We live inside a galaxy—a barred spiral of several hundred billion stars, with a supermassive black hole at its center. The Milky Way is our address in the universe.

## How FTD Produces Galactic Structure
The Milky Way's structure emerges from flux dynamics at galactic scales:

- **Spiral arms** = density waves in the stellar flux, triggering star formation as material passes through
- **Dark matter halo** = unmanifested flux (s = 0) providing the gravitational scaffold
- **Central black hole** = extreme flux concentration where nothing escapes
- **Rotation curve** = flat because dark matter flux dominates beyond the visible disk

The barred spiral morphology reflects the angular momentum distribution of the primordial flux cloud.

## Components

### Thin Disk

- Contains most visible stars
- Young to intermediate age
- Star formation ongoing
- Circular orbits
- Scale height: ~300 pc

### Thick Disk

- Older stars
- More vertical extent
- Scale height: ~1000 pc
- Formed early or from mergers

### Bulge/Bar

- Central concentration
- Bar ~10,000 ly long
- Mix of old and young stars
- Contains central black hole

### Halo

- Spheroidal distribution
- Old, metal-poor stars
- Globular clusters (~150)
- Extends to ~300,000 ly

### Dark Matter Halo

- Dominates mass
- Extends to ~600,000 ly
- ~85% of total mass
- Inferred from rotation curve

## Spiral Arms

### Major Arms

| Arm | Distance from Sun |
|----|-------------------|
| Perseus | 6,000 ly |
| Sagittarius | 8,000 ly |
| Scutum-Centaurus | 12,000 ly |
| Norma | 15,000 ly |

Our Sun is in the Orion Spur, between Perseus and Sagittarius.

### Why Arms?

Density wave theory:
- Arms are waves, not material structures
- Stars and gas enter and exit
- Compression triggers star formation
- Young, bright stars make arms visible

## The Galactic Center

### Sagittarius A*

Supermassive black hole:
- Mass: 4.1 million M☉
- Distance: 26,000 ly
- Schwarzschild radius: ~12 million km
- Currently quiescent

### Central Parsec

Extreme environment:
- High stellar density
- Young massive stars (unexpected!)
- Streamers of hot gas
- Strong magnetic fields

## Solar Neighborhood

### The Sun's Location
- 26,000 ly from center
- In thin disk
- Orion Spur
- Moving at 220 km/s around center
- Orbital period: ~230 million years

### Nearby Stars

Within 20 light-years:
- ~100 known stellar systems
- Proxima Centauri: 4.24 ly
- Barnard's Star: 5.96 ly
- Sirius: 8.6 ly

## Satellite Galaxies

The Milky Way has ~60 known satellites:

| Galaxy | Distance | Mass |
|--------|----------|------|
| Large Magellanic Cloud | 160,000 ly | 10¹⁰ M☉ |
| Small Magellanic Cloud | 200,000 ly | 7×10⁹ M☉ |
| Sagittarius Dwarf | 70,000 ly | 4×10⁸ M☉ |
| Ursa Minor Dwarf | 200,000 ly | 2×10⁷ M☉ |

Sagittarius is currently being cannibalized.

## Future

### Andromeda Collision

In ~4.5 billion years:
- Milky Way and Andromeda merge
- Will form elliptical galaxy ("Milkomeda")
- Sun may be flung to outskirts
- No direct stellar collisions expected

## In Simulation

```python
class MilkyWay:
    def __init__(self):
        self.disk = ThinDisk(radius=50000, mass=6e10)
        self.bulge = Bulge(radius=3000, mass=1e10)
        self.halo = DarkMatterHalo(radius=300000, mass=1e12)
        self.smbh = BlackHole(mass=4e6)
        self.satellites = load_satellites()

    def orbit_period(self, radius):
        # Flat rotation curve
        v_circular = 220  # km/s
        return 2 * pi * radius / v_circular
```

## Experiments

### Galactic Tour
Fly through the Milky Way. Visit center, arms, halo.

### Rotation Curve
Measure velocities at different radii. See flat curve (dark matter evidence).

### Future Merger
Watch Milky Way and Andromeda collide.

## Concepts

- **spiral-arms**: Density wave star formation regions
- **galactic-center**: Location of supermassive black hole
- **rotation-curve**: Velocity vs radius (flat = dark matter)
- **satellite-galaxies**: Small galaxies orbiting larger

## Transition

Our galaxy doesn't exist in isolation. Galaxies interact, merge, and transform. Next, we explore these cosmic collisions.
