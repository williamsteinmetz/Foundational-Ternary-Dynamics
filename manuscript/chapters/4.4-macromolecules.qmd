*"The giants of the molecular world"*

## Key Revelation
From simple building blocks, enormous structures emerge. Proteins fold, DNA encodes, and polymers give materials their properties. Life is macromolecular.

## Proteins

Chains of amino acids that do everything in life.

### Amino Acids

20 standard amino acids, each with:
- Amino group (-NH₂)
- Carboxyl group (-COOH)
- R group (side chain—what makes each unique)

```
        R    O
        |    ‖
H₂N - C - C - OH
        |
        H
```

### Peptide Bonds

Amino acids link by condensation:
```
     O    H        O
     ‖    |        ‖
-C - N - C - C - N - C-
         |    ‖    |
         R    O    R
```

### Protein Structure

| Level | Description | Forces |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| Primary | Amino acid sequence | Covalent (peptide bonds) |
| Secondary | α-helix, β-sheet | Hydrogen bonds |
| Tertiary | 3D folding | All forces |
| Quaternary | Multiple chains | All forces |

### Protein Functions

- **Enzymes**: Catalyze reactions
- **Structural**: Collagen, keratin
- **Transport**: Hemoglobin
- **Immune**: Antibodies
- **Signaling**: Hormones

## Nucleic Acids

Information storage molecules.

### DNA Structure

```
Sugar-Phosphate backbone
        |
    5'— P — S — P — S — P — S —3'
            |       |       |
            A ≡ T   G ≡ C   A ≡ T
            |       |       |
    3'— P — S — P — S — P — S —5'

Base pairs:
  A-T: 2 hydrogen bonds
  G-C: 3 hydrogen bonds
```

### Double Helix

- 10 base pairs per turn
- 3.4 nm pitch
- Major and minor grooves
- Antiparallel strands

### RNA

- Single-stranded (usually)
- Uracil instead of thymine
- Sugar is ribose (not deoxyribose)
- Types: mRNA, tRNA, rRNA

## Polymers

Long chains of repeating units (monomers).

### Addition Polymers

Monomers add without losing atoms:

| Monomer | Polymer | Use |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Ethylene | Polyethylene | Plastic bags |
| Propylene | Polypropylene | Containers |
| Styrene | Polystyrene | Foam, packaging |
| Vinyl chloride | PVC | Pipes |

```
n(CH₂=CH₂) → -[-CH₂-CH₂-]ₙ-
```

### Condensation Polymers

Monomers lose small molecule (usually water):

| Type | Example | Use |
|------|---------|-----|
| Polyester | PET | Bottles, fabric |
| Polyamide | Nylon | Fibers, fabric |
| Polyurethane | PU | Foam, coatings |

## Carbohydrates

Sugars and their polymers.

### Monosaccharides

Simple sugars: glucose, fructose, galactose (all C₆H₁₂O₆)

### Disaccharides

Two sugars linked:
- Sucrose = glucose + fructose
- Lactose = glucose + galactose
- Maltose = glucose + glucose

### Polysaccharides

| Name | Function | Source |
|------|----------|--------|
| Starch | Energy storage | Plants |
| Glycogen | Energy storage | Animals |
| Cellulose | Structure | Plant cell walls |
| Chitin | Structure | Fungi, arthropods |

## Lipids

Not true polymers, but complex molecules.

### Fatty Acids

Long hydrocarbon chain + carboxyl group:
```
CH₃(CH₂)ₙCOOH
```

- Saturated: No double bonds, solid at room temp
- Unsaturated: Double bonds, liquid at room temp

### Phospholipids

Basis of cell membranes:
```
     Hydrophilic head (phosphate)
            ↓
        ┌──────┐
        │ P    │
        └──┬───┘
           │
     ══════╪══════  ← Hydrophobic tails (fatty acids)
           │
     ══════╪══════
```

## Experiments

### Protein Folding
Watch a chain of amino acids fold into its final structure.

### DNA Replication
Observe the double helix unzip and copy.

### Polymer Synthesis
Build polymers from monomers. Compare properties.

## Concepts

- **protein**: Amino acid polymer with complex structure
- **nucleic-acid**: Information-carrying polymer (DNA, RNA)
- **polymer**: Long chain of repeating units
- **carbohydrate**: Sugar or sugar polymer

## Transition

Macromolecules have complex properties. Now we zoom out to see how molecules aggregate into bulk matter—the different states and their transitions.
