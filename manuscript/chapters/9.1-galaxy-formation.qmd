# Galaxy Formation {#sec-galaxy-formation}

*"From seeds to spirals"*

::: {.callout-note}
## Key Revelation
Galaxies form from tiny density fluctuations in the early universe, amplified by gravity over billions of years. Dark matter provides the scaffolding.

## How FTD Produces Galaxy Formation
Galaxy formation emerges from the flux field's response to primordial perturbations:

- **Dark matter halos** = unmanifested flux concentrations (s = 0) that source gravity
- **Density fluctuations** = inherited from quantum fluctuations in the early flux field
- **Gravitational instability** = flux gradients amplifying initial perturbations
- **Baryon infall** = manifested matter (s ≠ 0) following the gravitational flux wells

The cosmic web structure reflects the topology of flux concentrations on cosmological scales.

## Initial Conditions

### Density Fluctuations

The early universe was almost, but not quite, uniform:
- Quantum fluctuations during inflation
- Stretched to cosmic scales
- Density variations: δρ/ρ ~ 10⁻⁵

### Seeds

These tiny variations are the seeds of all cosmic structure:
- Slightly overdense regions attract more matter
- Grow through gravitational instability
- Eventually collapse into galaxies

## The Role of Dark Matter

Dark matter dominates structure formation:
- Doesn't interact with light (no pressure)
- Collapses first
- Creates gravitational wells
- Baryons fall in later

### The Cosmic Web

Dark matter forms:
```
    ┌─────○─────────○─────┐
    │      ╲       ╱      │
    ○───────●─────●───────○
    │      ╱       ╲      │
    │     ╱         ╲     │
    ○────●───────────●────○

● = Dark matter halo (galaxy sites)
─ = Filaments
○ = Nodes (galaxy clusters)
```

## Formation Pathways

```

### Bottom-Up Process

1. **Dark matter halos form** (z ~ 20-30)
2. **Gas falls in** (cools, condenses)
3. **First stars form** (z ~ 20)
4. **Small galaxies merge** (z ~ 10-2)
5. **Continued growth** (ongoing)

## Gas Cooling and Star Formation

### Cooling Time

Gas must cool to collapse:
$$
t_{\text{cool}} = \frac{3k_BT n}{2 \Lambda(T) n^2}
$$

Where Λ(T) is the cooling function.

If $t_{\text{cool}} < t_{\text{Hubble}}$: gas can cool, collapse, form stars.

### The Cooling Curve

```

       │╱        ╲
       └───────────────── Log T
        10⁴   10⁶   10⁸
```

Efficient cooling at 10⁴-10⁶ K.

## Angular Momentum

Galaxies spin because:
- Tidal torques from neighbors
- Random motions during collapse
- Conservation of angular momentum

### Disk Formation

Gas with angular momentum settles into disk:
- Falls to center
- Spins up (conservation)
- Flattens perpendicular to rotation axis

## Feedback

Star formation regulates itself:

### Stellar Feedback
- Supernovae heat and expel gas
- Stellar winds inject energy
- UV radiation ionizes gas

### AGN Feedback
- Central black hole accretes
- Jets and outflows
- Can quench star formation

## Galaxy Assembly

```python
def galaxy_formation(dark_matter_halo):
    # Baryons fall into dark matter well
    gas = accrete_baryons(halo)

    while universe.age < 13.8_billion_years:
        # Gas cools
        if cooling_time(gas) < hubble_time():
            gas.cool()
            gas.condense()

        # Stars form from dense gas
        stars = form_stars(dense_gas)

        # Feedback regulates
        feedback(stars, gas)
        feedback(central_black_hole, gas)

        # Mergers
        if merger_event():
            merge_with(other_galaxy)
```

## Experiments

### Halo Collapse
Watch dark matter halo form from initial fluctuations.

### Disk Formation
See gas settle into rotating disk.

### Merger Simulation
Collide two galaxies. Watch the result.

## Concepts

- **hierarchical-merging**: Small objects combine into larger
- **dark-matter-halo**: Invisible gravitational scaffold
- **cooling-flow**: Gas radiating energy and condensing
- **feedback**: Self-regulation of star formation

## Transition

Galaxies form from the same processes at every mass scale. Now let's explore the variety of galaxies that result—spirals, ellipticals, and more.
