## Key Insight
Interference arises from the vector addition of flux fields. Constructive interference occurs where vectors align; destructive interference occurs where they oppose.

## Geometry, Not Mystery

Interference is **what happens when two potential fields overlap**.

When two waves meet in the same region of space, their flux vectors add:

$$
\vec{J}_{\text{combined}} = \vec{J}_A + \vec{J}_B
$$

The result depends on the relative alignment:

- **Vectors align** → constructive interference (higher intensity)
- **Vectors oppose** → destructive interference (lower intensity)

**No complex amplitudes required.** Flux vectors in 3D Euclidean space produce interference naturally.

## Constructive Interference

When two flux sources produce aligned vectors:

```
Source A: →→→→→
Source B: →→→→→
Result:   →→→→→→→→→→ (doubled amplitude)
```

The combined density is higher. Genesis is more likely.

## Destructive Interference

When two flux sources produce opposing vectors:

```
Source A: →→→→→
Source B: ←←←←←
Result:   (near zero)
```

The combined density is lower. Genesis becomes impossible in these regions.

## The Double-Slit Pattern

Consider two flux sources separated by a small distance:

1. Each source emits expanding waves
2. Waves overlap in the region beyond
3. Some regions have aligned flux (bright bands)
4. Some regions have opposing flux (dark bands)

Manifestation events occur preferentially in the high-intensity regions where flux density exceeds the threshold $K_B$.

## Wave Propagation

The discrete wave equation governs propagation:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \nabla^2 u
$$

Discretized for our lattice:

1. **Calculate Laplacian**: Average of 6 neighbors minus center × 6
2. **Update wave velocity**: Add Laplacian × c²
3. **Update flux**: Add wave velocity
4. **Apply damping**: Prevent unbounded growth

### Implementation

```python
for voxel in grid:
    # Average of neighbors minus center
    neighbors = voxel.neighbors
    avg = sum(n.flux for n in neighbors) / 6
    laplacian = avg - voxel.flux

    voxel.wave_velocity += C**2 * laplacian
    voxel.flux += voxel.wave_velocity
    voxel.flux *= (1 - DAMPING)
```

## Experiments

### Two-Source Interference
Set up two flux sources. Watch the interference pattern emerge. Bright and dark bands form naturally.

### Phase Control
Adjust the relative phase between two sources. Watch the pattern shift. At 180° out of phase, destructive interference dominates.

### Manifestation Mapping
Map where particles appear over many genesis events. They cluster in the bright bands, never in the dark bands.

## Mathematical Details

### Intensity

The intensity at any point is the squared magnitude of the combined flux:

$$
I = |\vec{J}_{\text{combined}}|^2 = |\vec{J}_A + \vec{J}_B|^2
$$

Expanding:

$$
I = |\vec{J}_A|^2 + |\vec{J}_B|^2 + 2\vec{J}_A \cdot \vec{J}_B
$$

The cross term $2\vec{J}_A \cdot \vec{J}_B$ determines interference:
- Positive (aligned): constructive
- Negative (opposed): destructive

### No Complex Numbers

Classical wave interference requires complex amplitudes to track phase. In FTD, the 3D vector nature of flux naturally encodes phase information. The direction IS the phase. **[EMERGENT: vector phase encoding arises from the 3D structure, not imposed separately]**

## Concepts

- **vector-addition**: Flux fields add as vectors
- **constructive-interference**: Aligned phases reinforce
- **destructive-interference**: Opposed phases cancel
- **wave-nature**: Reality's underlying wave structure

## Transition

Interference shapes where things can exist. But existence is not permanent—particles are born, live, and die in an eternal cycle. Next, we explore the cycle of existence.
