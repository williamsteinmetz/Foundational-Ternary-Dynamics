# The Causal Loop {#sec-causal-loop}

*"The heartbeat of the universe"*

::: {.callout-note}
## Key Revelation
Every tick of existence follows the same 13 steps, in the same order. This is not a rule—it is the structure of causality itself.
:::

## The Universal Tick

The universe advances one tick at a time. Each tick follows this sequence:

```

## Why This Order?

The sequence is not arbitrary. Causality demands it.

- You cannot apply forces without first computing fields
- You cannot move without first applying forces
- You cannot detect collisions without first moving
- You cannot bind structures without first detecting what exists

Each step depends on the results of previous steps.

## The 13 Steps Explained

### 1. TIME GATE
Check each voxel's phase accumulator τ. If τ ≥ 1, the voxel updates this tick. High-energy particles update less often (time dilation).

### 2. DECAY
Apply entropy to unlocked particles:
```python
particle.flux *= (1 - DECAY_RATE)
```
Locked (bound) particles skip this step.

### 3. EXISTENCE
Check thresholds:
- If density < KB and state ≠ 0: Evaporate (±1 → 0)
- If density ≥ KB and state = 0: Maybe genesis (0 → ±1)

### 4. PROPAGATE
Flux waves advance through the lattice. Wave velocity updates flux.

### 5. SUPERPOSE
Where multiple flux contributions overlap, they sum as vectors.

### 6. COMPUTE FIELDS
Calculate derived fields:
- Gradients: ∇ρ, ∇q
- Curl: ∇ × J
- Divergence: ∇ · J

### 7. FORCES
Calculate all forces on each particle:
- Gravity: $F_g = G \cdot \nabla\bar{\rho}$
- Electric: $F_e = -q \cdot \nabla\bar{q}$
- Magnetic: $F_m = \beta_m \cdot (\nabla \times J) \times \hat{J}$
- Strong: $F_s = g^2 \cdot e^{-mr}(1+mr)/r^2$
- Weak: Transmutation check

### 8. INTEGRATE
Apply accumulated forces to particle velocities:
```python
particle.velocity += particle.force_accumulator / particle.mass
particle.force_accumulator = [0, 0, 0]  # Reset
```

### 9. MOVE
Update positions (with speed limit C):
```python
speed = |particle.velocity|
if speed > C:
    particle.velocity *= C / speed
particle.position += particle.velocity
```

### 10. COLLIDE
Handle interactions:
- Empty target → move there
- Same-sign target → elastic collision
- Opposite-sign target → annihilation

### 11. TRANSMUTE
Weak force effects: If stress S exceeds threshold, particle may flip polarity and emit neutrino.

### 12. BIND
Detect stable structures (triads). Lock them against decay.

### 13. INCREMENT
Advance the global tick counter: `t += 1`

## Experiments

### Single Step Mode
Execute one tick at a time. Watch each of the 13 phases in slow motion.

### Phase Isolation
View only one phase at a time. See how FORCES differs from MOVE differs from COLLIDE.

### Order Experiment
Understand why order matters. What happens if you MOVE before computing FORCES?

## The Rhythm

Speed up the simulation. Watch the universe pulse with the rhythm of existence.

This is the heartbeat:
- **Tick**: one cycle complete
- **Tick**: another cycle
- **Tick**: forever forward

The causal loop never stops. It cannot stop—for the loop IS time.

## Concepts

- **tick**: The fundamental unit of time
- **causal-loop**: The 13-step update sequence
- **phase-order**: Why steps must occur in this order

## Transition

The causal loop governs how time advances. But time itself is not uniform—high-energy particles experience time differently. Next, we explore time dilation and causality.
