*"The tuning of reality"*

::: {.callout-note}
## Key Revelation
From six constants, an entire universe unfolds. Change any of them, and chemistry fails, stars don't form, or observers cannot exist.

## Derivation Status

| Constant | Status | Scope |
|----------|--------|-------|
| C, H | Axiomatic | Core paper |
| ALPHA | **DERIVED** | Core paper (1.26 ppm) |
| KB, PHI, GRAVITY_BIAS | **DERIVED** [†] | Companion work |

The core paper derives α from the master quadratic. Other derived constants use α plus additional framework relations developed in companion papers.

## The Fundamental Constants

The entire framework depends on just six numbers:

| Constant | Value | Role | Status |
|----------|-------|------|--------|
| **C** | 1.0 | Speed of causality (maximum velocity) | Axiomatic |
| **H** | 1.0 | Planck resolution (minimum distance/time) | Axiomatic |
| **KB** | 0.511 | Existence threshold (minimum manifestation energy) | Derived [†] |
| **ALPHA** | 0.00729 | Fine structure constant (~1/137) | **Derived** |
| **PHI** | 1.618 | Golden ratio (stability geometry) | Derived [†] |
| **GRAVITY_BIAS** | 0.01 | Gravitational coupling strength | Derived [†] |

Plus the decay rate:

| Constant | Value | Role | Status |
|----------|-------|------|--------|
| **DECAY_RATE** | 0.00729 | Entropy rate (= ALPHA) | Identified [†] |

## Axioms (Hard Limits)

Some constants are definitional—they establish the units:

### C = 1.0 (Speed of Causality)
The maximum rate at which information can propagate. One voxel per tick. This is not a velocity limit but a causality limit—nothing can influence anything faster than this.

### H = 1.0 (Planck Resolution)
The minimum unit of space and time. One voxel. One tick. There is no "between" these values.

### KB = 0.511 (Existence Threshold)
The minimum energy for manifestation. Numerically anchored to the electron rest mass scale in the chosen units; companion relations then connect this value to the framework integers once α is fixed.

## Tuning Constants

Other constants are tunable—they determine *behavior* within the framework:

### ALPHA = 0.00729 (Fine Structure)

The fine structure constant determines the strength of electromagnetic interactions. The experimentally measured value is α = 1/137.035999177(21) [@codata2022].

## Derived, Not Assumed
Unlike other constants in this section, α is **not** a free parameter. It emerges from geometric constraints on a self-referential curve. See @sec-lemniscate-alpha for the full derivation, which achieves 1.26 ppm accuracy.
:::

This single number controls:
- Atomic structure
- Chemical bonding
- Light-matter interactions
- Decay rates

### PHI = 1.618 (Golden Ratio)

The golden ratio appears in stable geometries. Triads (nucleons) use this ratio for their internal structure. It provides maximum stability.

### GRAVITY_BIAS = 0.01 (Gravitational Coupling)

Controls the strength of gravity relative to other forces. Much weaker than electromagnetic force, but cumulative over large masses.

### DECAY_RATE = 0.00729 (Entropy Rate)

Controls how quickly unbound particles lose energy. Set equal to ALPHA, creating an elegant symmetry: the rate of electromagnetic interaction equals the rate of entropic decay.

For clarity: this equality is an identification used in the model’s parameterization; its status and scope are tracked in the Assumption Ledger.

## What If?

What happens if we change these constants?

### Increase ALPHA
- Atoms become unstable (electrons fall into nucleus)
- Chemistry fails
- No molecules, no life

### Decrease ALPHA
- Atoms become too loosely bound
- Chemical reactions too weak
- No complex chemistry

### Increase KB
- Fewer particles can exist
- Universe too sparse for structure

### Decrease KB
- Too many particles manifest
- Universe too dense
- Runaway pair production

### Increase GRAVITY_BIAS
- Stars collapse too quickly
- No stable fusion
- No heavy elements

### Decrease GRAVITY_BIAS
- No galaxy formation
- No stars
- Just diffuse gas forever

## The Anthropic Window

Our constants fall within a narrow window that allows:
- Stable atoms
- Complex chemistry
- Long-lived stars
- Heavy element formation
- Planetary systems
- Observers

This is the "fine-tuning problem." Why these values?

### Possible Explanations

1. **Multiverse**: Many universes exist with different constants; we observe one that allows observers (selection effect)

2. **Necessity**: Only these values are mathematically self-consistent

3. **Design**: The constants were chosen for a purpose

4. **This Simulation**: We chose constants to match our universe because that's what we wanted to model

## Experiments

### Break Chemistry
Increase ALPHA gradually. Watch atomic orbitals destabilize. See chemistry fail.

### Instant Decay
Maximize DECAY_RATE. Watch particles evaporate almost immediately.

### Find Stability
Start with random constants. Try to tune them to create stable atoms and chemistry. Appreciate how narrow the window is.

### Constant Playground
Full control over all constants. Explore the parameter space. Find surprising configurations.

## Mathematical Relationships

### Energy-Mass Equivalence
$$
E = mc^2 = m \cdot 1^2 = m
$$
(In our units, c = 1, so E = m)

### Threshold Condition
$$
\rho \geq K_B \implies \text{manifestation possible}
$$

### Decay Evolution
$$
\rho(t) = \rho_0 \cdot (1 - \text{DECAY\_RATE})^t
$$

Time to half-density: $t_{1/2} = \frac{\ln 2}{\ln(1/(1-\text{DECAY\_RATE}))}$

## Concepts

- **constants**: The fundamental parameters that shape reality
- **fine-tuning**: Sensitivity to constant values
- **anthropic-principle**: Why these values allow observers

## Chapter Summary
**Six constants define the FTD framework**: C (causality speed), H (Planck resolution), KB (existence threshold), ALPHA (fine structure), PHI (golden ratio), and GRAVITY_BIAS (gravitational coupling). Of these, **α is derived** from geometric constraints (1.26 ppm accuracy), while the others are either axiomatic (C, H) or derived from α via framework relations. The constants fall within a narrow **anthropic window**—small changes would prevent stable atoms, stars, or observers from existing.

## Transition

We have presented six constants as the tuning parameters of reality. But are they truly free parameters? The next chapter (@sec-lemniscate-alpha) reveals something remarkable: at least one of these constants—the fine structure constant α—is not arbitrary at all. It emerges from the geometry of self-reference.
