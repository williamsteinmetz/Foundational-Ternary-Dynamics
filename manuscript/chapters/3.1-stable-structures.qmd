# Stable Structures {#sec-stable-structures}

*Building on the manifestation dynamics of Book I and the particle physics of Book II, we now examine how particles combine into stable structures.*

*"What persists through time"*

::: {.callout-note}
## Key Revelation
Stability arises from geometry. Three particles in an equilateral triangle (a triad) form a structure that resists decay. This is how protons and neutrons persist for billions of years.
:::

## The Triad

The most fundamental stable structure is the **triad**: three particles arranged in an equilateral triangle.

### Detection Criteria

A triad is recognized when:
1. Three particles within 2.0 voxels of each other
2. Approximately equilateral geometry
3. All particles have the same sign (+1 or -1)

### Geometry

```
     A
    /|\
   / | \
  /  |  \
 B---+---C

Distance AB = BC = CA = √2 (edge neighbors)
```

### Stability Properties

When a triad is detected:
- `is_locked = True` for all three particles
- Decay rate → 0
- Binding energy = KB × PHI
- Structure persists indefinitely

## Proton Configuration

The proton consists of two up quarks and one down quark:

```
     u (+2/3)
    /   \
   /     \
u (+2/3)--d (-1/3)

Net charge: +2/3 + 2/3 - 1/3 = +1
Mass: ~9.0 units
Stability: Effectively infinite
```

The strong force binds the quarks. The geometry provides stability.

## Neutron Configuration

The neutron consists of one up quark and two down quarks:

```
     u (+2/3)
    /   \
   /     \
d (-1/3)--d (-1/3)

Net charge: +2/3 - 1/3 - 1/3 = 0
Mass: ~9.0 units
Stability: Stable in nucleus, decays when free (~15 minutes)
```

Free neutrons decay via the weak force:
```
n → p + e⁻ + ν̄ₑ
```

## Electron Shells

Electrons organize around nuclei in shells:

### Shell Structure

| Shell | n | Max electrons | Radius (voxels) |
|-------|---|---------------|-----------------|
| 1s | 1 | 2 | 4-6 |
| 2s | 2 | 2 | 8-10 |
| 2p | 2 | 6 | 10-12 |
| 3s | 3 | 2 | 12-14 |
| 3p | 3 | 6 | 14-16 |
| 3d | 3 | 10 | 16-18 |
| 4s | 4 | 2 | 18-20 |

### Shell Stability

Electrons in shells have `shell_n` set. Full shells are particularly stable:
- Helium: 2 electrons (1s²) — noble gas
- Neon: 10 electrons ([He]2s²2p⁶) — noble gas
- Argon: 18 electrons ([Ne]3s²3p⁶) — noble gas

## Orbital Shapes

Different orbitals have different geometries:

### s Orbitals (Spherical)
No angular nodes. Spherically symmetric around nucleus.

### p Orbitals (Dumbbell)
One angular node. Three orientations (px, py, pz).

### d Orbitals (Cloverleaf)
Two angular nodes. Five orientations.

### f Orbitals (Complex)
Three angular nodes. Seven orientations.

## Binding Energy

The energy required to break a stable structure:

### Triads
$$
E_{\text{bind}} = K_B \times \Phi = 0.511 \times 1.618 \approx 0.83
$$

### Electron Shells
$$
E_n = -\frac{13.6 \times Z^2}{n^2} \text{ (hydrogen-like)}
$$

## Lock Mechanism

When `is_locked = True`:

```python
def apply_decay(particle):
    if particle.is_locked:
        return  # No decay for locked particles

    particle.flux *= (1 - DECAY_RATE)
```

Locked particles don't lose energy. They persist until an external force breaks the structure.

## Experiments

### Triad Formation
Create three same-sign particles close together. Watch them lock into a triad.

### Shell Filling
Add electrons to a nucleus one by one. Watch them organize into shells.

### Stability Test
Create various configurations. See which ones lock and persist.

## Concepts

- **triad**: Three-particle stable structure (nucleons)
- **shell**: Electron orbital around nucleus
- **binding-energy**: Energy to break a structure
- **is_locked**: Stability flag preventing decay

## Transition

Stable structures form atoms. Next, we explore the full periodic table of elements—all the atoms that can exist.
