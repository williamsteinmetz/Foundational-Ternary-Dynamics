# Assumption Ledger {#sec-assumption-ledger}

*"Intellectual honesty requires knowing what we assume, derive, and conjecture."*

::: {.callout-important}
## Purpose of This Chapter
This chapter categorizes every major claim in FTD by its epistemic status. Before accepting any claim, check here to see whether it is an axiom (assumed), theorem (derived), emergence (simulated), or conjecture (proposed).

## Core Paper vs. Companion Work

**Core paper (T1-T6)** establishes: lattice structure → elliptic fibration → CM selection → master quadratic → α = 1/137.036

**Selection Principles (S1-S4)** are argued but not uniquely proven:
- [S1] CM curves preferred by symmetry
- [S2] j = 1728 from 4-fold symmetry
- [S3] Quadratic form (uniqueness not proven)
- [S4] Coefficient 16 from lattice DoF

**Companion work [†]** extends using α + framework relations.

## Open Questions

| Question | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| ~~Can GRAVITY_BIAS be derived?~~ | [V] RESOLVED | 1/(b₃+N_c)² = 0.01 exactly |
| ~~Why 3 generations?~~ | [V] RESOLVED | floor(N_c) = 3 from master quadratic |
| ~~Can Λ be derived?~~ | [V] RESOLVED | α^57 = 10^-121.8 (0.16% error) |
| ~~Is the Lemniscate-Alpha unique?~~ | [V] **RESOLVED (scoped)** | Unique within the stated constraint class: structure fixed by self-reference, coefficients encode framework integers |
| ~~What selects these 4 integers?~~ | [V] **RESOLVED** | Fibonacci skeleton: b₃=N_base+N_c, N_eff=F(b₃) |

### The Fibonacci Skeleton Resolution

The four framework integers {7, 3, 13, 4} are not arbitrary. They satisfy:

1. **Loop self-enumeration**: $b_3 = N_{\text{base}} + N_c = 4 + 3 = 7$
2. **Fibonacci embedding**: $n_{\text{eff}} = F_7 = F_{b_3} = 13$
3. **Power-of-2 closure**: $2^{N_c} = 2^3 = 8 = F_6$ (only Fibonacci power of 2 > 2)
4. **Fixed point**: $T(b_3 + N_c) = T(10) = 55 = F_{10}$ (triangular = Fibonacci)
5. **Content counting**: $N_c \times N_{\text{base}} = 12 = n_{\text{eff}} - 1$ (fermions)

**Uniqueness Theorem**: Only THREE solutions exist:

| Solution | {b₃, N_c, N_eff, N_base} | Fermions | Physics |
|----------|--------------------------|----------|---------|
| Empty | {1, 1, 1, 0} | 0 | None |
| Minimal | {5, 1, 5, 4} | 4 | No color confinement |
| **Standard** | **{7, 3, 13, 4}** | **12** | **Our universe** |

Within this constraint class, the Standard Model solution is singled out among the listed alternatives for $N_c > 1$. Any broader claim of necessity should be read as conditional on the stated skeleton constraints. See @sec-uniqueness.

### The Lemniscate-Alpha Uniqueness Resolution

The Lemniscate-Alpha curve is **unique within the stated construction**. The argument follows a chain of determinations under the book's explicit constraints:

1. **Structure fixed**: 5 modes at frequencies {1, 2, 4, 8, 16}
   - Self-reference requires N² = highest frequency
   - Only N = 4 works: 4² = 16 = 2⁴

2. **Coefficients encode framework integers**:
   - Mode 8: $a_8 + |b_8| = 2/5 + 7/20 = 3/4 = N_c/N_{\text{base}}$
   - Mode 16: $a_{16} = b_{16} = 1/16 = 1/N_{\text{base}}^2$

3. **G* self-consistently determined**:
   - $G^* = \frac{(1/\alpha) \times N_c}{(1/\alpha) + N_c}$ (harmonic-mean relation)
   - $G^* = 3 - \frac{17\alpha}{3}$ where 17 = $n_{\text{eff}} + N_{\text{base}}$

4. **Framework integers unique** (by Fibonacci skeleton)

**Result (scoped)**: Given the stated constraints, the chain fixes the construction. See @sec-curve-uniqueness.

## How to Use This Ledger

1. **Before accepting a claim**: Check its status here
2. **If AXIOM**: Cannot be proven within FTD; evaluate on coherence
3. **If DERIVED**: Trace the proof; verify the math
4. **If EMERGENT**: Run the simulation; see for yourself
5. **If IMPOSED**: Recognize this is phenomenological
6. **If CONJECTURE**: Treat with appropriate skepticism
7. **If OPEN**: Don't assume it's solved

## The Honest Assessment

FTD is a **structured framework** with clearly delineated scope:

### Core Paper Establishes
- **4 theorems** (T1-T6): rigorous derivations from axioms
- **Fine structure constant α** to 1.26 ppm
- **Coefficient 16** from lattice degrees of freedom
- **Selection Principles S1-S4**: argued but not uniquely proven

### Companion Work Extends
- **31 additional derivations** using α + framework relations
- Particle masses, flavor physics, cosmological constant
- These are mathematically consistent but form a separate derivation chain

### Key Distinction
The core paper makes no claim about particle masses, CKM/PMNS matrices, or cosmological parameters. Those are **companion work** using the same framework integers but requiring additional theoretical machinery.

We claim to have found a consistent ontology from which physics-like behavior emerges. We do NOT claim to have derived all of physics from the core paper alone.

The value of FTD lies in:
1. The emergent features (these are genuine discoveries)
2. The derived constants (these reduce free parameters)
3. The explicit distinction between core and companion (this is intellectual honesty)

What we impose, we label. What we derive, we scope. What we conjecture, we test.
