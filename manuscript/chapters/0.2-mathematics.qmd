## Discrete Differential Geometry

Standard calculus assumes continuous space. FTD operates on a discrete lattice. We need discrete analogs of familiar operations.

### The Lattice

Space is a 3D integer lattice $\mathbb{Z}^3$. Each point $(i, j, k)$ is a voxel.

### Discrete Derivatives

For a scalar field $f$ defined on the lattice:

**Forward difference:**
$$\partial_x^+ f(x) = f(x + \hat{e}_x) - f(x)$$

**Backward difference:**
$$\partial_x^- f(x) = f(x) - f(x - \hat{e}_x)$$

**Central difference:**
$$\partial_x f(x) = \frac{f(x + \hat{e}_x) - f(x - \hat{e}_x)}{2}$$

### Discrete Gradient

For scalar field $f$:

$$\nabla f = \left(\partial_x f, \partial_y f, \partial_z f\right)$$

Using central differences:

$$
\nabla f(x) = \frac{1}{2}\begin{pmatrix}
f(x+\hat{e}_x) - f(x-\hat{e}_x) \\
f(x+\hat{e}_y) - f(x-\hat{e}_y) \\
f(x+\hat{e}_z) - f(x-\hat{e}_z)
\end{pmatrix}
$$

### Discrete Divergence

For vector field $\mathbf{J} = (J_x, J_y, J_z)$:

$$\nabla \cdot \mathbf{J} = \partial_x J_x + \partial_y J_y + \partial_z J_z$$

$$= \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i \in \{x,y,z\}} \left[J_i(x + \hat{e}_i) - J_i(x - \hat{e}_i)\right]$$

### Discrete Curl

$$\nabla \times \mathbf{J} = \begin{pmatrix}
\partial_y J_z - \partial_z J_y \\
\partial_z J_x - \partial_x J_z \\
\partial_x J_y - \partial_y J_x
\end{pmatrix}$$

### Discrete Laplacian

$$\nabla^2 f = \sum_{\text{neighbors}} f(\text{neighbor}) - 6 \cdot f(\text{center})$$

For the 6-connected neighborhood. For 26-connected:

$$\nabla^2 f = \sum_{n \in N_{26}} w_n \cdot f(n) - f(\text{center})$$

Where $w_n$ weights by distance.

## Lattice Theory

### The Moore Neighborhood

In 3D, the **Moore neighborhood** of a cell includes all 26 adjacent cells:
- 6 face neighbors (distance 1)
- 12 edge neighbors (distance √2)
- 8 corner neighbors (distance √3)

### Cellular Automata

A **cellular automaton** is defined by:
1. A lattice (grid of cells)
2. A set of states each cell can take
3. A neighborhood definition
4. An update rule

FTD is a cellular automaton with:
- Lattice: $\mathbb{Z}^3$ (or finite periodic box)
- States: {−1, 0, +1} per cell
- Neighborhood: 26-cell Moore
- Rule: The causal loop (see @sec-causal-loop)

### Discrete Time Evolution

Updates are synchronous: all cells update based on the previous tick's state. This ensures:
- Determinism (same initial state → same evolution)
- Reversibility in principle (though not in practice due to decay)
- Causality (effects propagate at most 1 cell per tick)

## Helmholtz Decomposition

Any vector field can be decomposed into irrotational and solenoidal parts:

$$\mathbf{J} = \mathbf{J}_L + \mathbf{J}_T$$

Where:
- $\mathbf{J}_L$ (longitudinal): $\nabla \times \mathbf{J}_L = 0$
- $\mathbf{J}_T$ (transverse): $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{J}_T = 0$

### Physical Interpretation

| Component | Constraint | Physical Role |
|-----------|------------|---------------|
| $\mathbf{J}_L$ | Curl-free | Tied to charges (Gauss's law) |
| $\mathbf{J}_T$ | Divergence-free | Propagating radiation |

### Degrees of Freedom

- Total: 3 (vector components)
- Constrained: 1 (longitudinal, determined by sources)
- Physical: 2 (transverse)

This is why photons have 2 polarizations, not 3.

## Group Theory for Gauge Symmetry

### What Is Gauge Symmetry?

A **gauge transformation** changes the mathematical description without changing physical observables.

For the flux field:
$$\mathbf{J} \to \mathbf{J} + \nabla \lambda$$

Under this transformation:
- $\nabla \times \mathbf{J}$ is unchanged (curl of gradient = 0)
- Physical observables depend only on $\nabla \times \mathbf{J}$
- The transformation is a **symmetry**

### U(1) Gauge Group

The electromagnetic gauge group is U(1)—the group of phase rotations:
$$\psi \to e^{i\theta} \psi$$

In FTD, this corresponds to adding a gradient to the flux field, which doesn't change the curl.

### SU(3) and Color (Speculative)

The three spatial axes may provide an SU(3) structure:
- "Color" = primary axis of flux alignment
- Color rotations = local axis rotations
- Color-neutral = symmetric across all axes

This interpretation remains speculative.

## Wave Equations

### The Continuous Wave Equation

$$\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \nabla^2 u$$

### Discrete Wave Equation

Using the discrete Laplacian and finite time steps:

$$u(t+1) - 2u(t) + u(t-1) = c^2 \nabla^2 u(t)$$

Or in update form:
$$u(t+1) = 2u(t) - u(t-1) + c^2 \nabla^2 u(t)$$

### Velocity-Verlet Integration

More stable integration using wave velocity $v$:

$$v(t+1) = v(t) + c^2 \nabla^2 u(t)$$
$$u(t+1) = u(t) + v(t+1)$$

With damping:
$$v(t+1) = (1 - \gamma)[v(t) + c^2 \nabla^2 u(t)]$$

## Probability and Entropy

### Genesis Probability

The probability of manifestation given energy $E$:

$$P_{\text{create}}(x) = \text{clamp}\left(1 - \exp\left(-\frac{E(x) - K_B}{K_B}\right), 0, 1\right)$$

### Shannon Entropy

For a probability distribution $\{p_i\}$:

$$H = -\sum_i p_i \log_2 p_i$$

### Boltzmann Entropy

For a system with $\Omega$ microstates:

$$S = k_B \ln \Omega$$

## Triangular Numbers

The $n$-th triangular number:

$$T(n) = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} = 1 + 2 + \cdots + n$$

These appear in the Lemniscate-Alpha derivation:
- $T(13) = 91$ encodes the Standard Model structure
- The scaling factor involves $T(n_{\text{eff}})$

## The Lemniscatic Constant

The classical **lemniscatic constant** (Gauss's constant):

$$\varpi = \int_0^1 \frac{dx}{\sqrt{1-x^4}} = \frac{\Gamma(1/4)^2}{4\sqrt{2\pi}} \approx 2.6221$$

::: {.callout-important}
## FTD Uses a Different G*
In this book, $G^*$ denotes the lemniscatic constant at the $j=1728$ point,
$$G^* = \frac{\sqrt{2}\,\Gamma(1/4)^2}{2\pi} \approx 2.9587,$$
not Gauss's classical constant $\varpi \approx 2.622$.

The Lemniscate-Alpha curve is presented as an independent geometric construction that reproduces the same numerical value to high precision, and $G^*$ then appears in the master quadratic. See @sec-glossary for terminology and scope.

## Transition

With mathematical tools in hand, we turn to the philosophical foundations: what kind of ontology does FTD propose, and how does it address the measurement problem?
