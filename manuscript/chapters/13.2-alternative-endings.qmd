*"Other fates for the cosmos"*

::: {.callout-note}
## Key Revelation
Heat death is not destiny's only option. Depending on dark energy's nature, the universe might end in fire (Big Rip), ice (Big Freeze), or renewal (Big Bounce). The cosmos has many possible endings.

## The Big Rip

### Dark Energy Intensifies

If dark energy's equation of state has w < -1 ("phantom energy"):
$$
\rho_{DE} \propto a^{-3(1+w)}
$$

With w < -1, dark energy density *increases* as universe expands.

### Timeline to Rip

| Time Before Rip | Event |
|-----------------|-------|
| 1 billion years | Galaxy clusters torn apart |
| 60 million years | Milky Way disrupted |
| 3 months | Solar system destroyed |
| 30 minutes | Earth explodes |
| 10⁻¹⁹ seconds | Atoms ripped apart |
| 0 | Spacetime itself tears |

### The Physics

Expansion accelerates without bound:
$$
H(t) \rightarrow \infty \text{ as } t \rightarrow t_{rip}
$$

Everything—galaxies, stars, planets, atoms, nuclei—torn apart.

### Survival?

None possible. Even fundamental particles disrupted.

## The Big Crunch

### Gravity Wins

If dark energy weakens or reverses:
- Expansion slows
- Stops
- Reverses

### The Collapse

```
Time evolution:
────────────────────────────
Expansion ───→ Maximum ───→ Contraction
                  ↓
              Structures merge
                  ↓
              Temperature rises
                  ↓
              All matter compressed
                  ↓
              Singularity (Big Crunch)
────────────────────────────
```

### The Final Moments

As universe contracts:
- CMB blueshifts, heats
- Stars cooked by radiation
- Nuclei dissociate
- Quark-gluon plasma
- Final singularity

Time reversal of Big Bang.

## The Big Bounce

### Crunch to Bang

Perhaps the universe cycles:
- Contracts to minimum
- Bounces
- Expands again
- Repeat forever

### Cyclic Cosmology

```

       │
       │    ╱╲    ╱╲    ╱╲
       │   ╱  ╲  ╱  ╲  ╱  ╲

       └─────────────────────── Time
           ↑      ↑      ↑
        Bounce  Bounce  Bounce
```

### Mechanisms

1. **Loop quantum gravity**: Quantum effects prevent singularity
2. **Ekpyrotic**: Colliding branes in string theory
3. **Conformal cyclic cosmology**: Penrose's CCC

### Information Survival?

Does information persist through bounces?
- If yes: Eternal memory
- If no: Each cycle fresh

## The Big Freeze (Heat Death Variant)

### Accelerating Expansion

With cosmological constant (w = -1):
- Expansion accelerates forever
- But not to rip—just faster expansion
- Dilution without destruction

### Isolation

Eventually:
- Galaxies beyond horizon
- Observable universe: Just our local group
- Then just our galaxy remnant
- Then just scattered particles

### Effective Heat Death

Same endpoint as heat death, but:
- Faster approach
- More isolated
- More expansion

## Vacuum Decay

### The False Vacuum

Our vacuum might not be ground state:
- Metastable configuration
- Could decay to true vacuum

### The Bubble of Death

```
True vacuum bubble nucleates:
         ⊙ ← bubble forms

Expands at nearly light speed:
      ╱───────╲
     ╱  True   ╲
    ╱  Vacuum   ╲
   ╱─────────────╲
  ↗               ↖
Expanding at ~c
```

### Consequences

Inside true vacuum:
- Different physics
- Different constants
- Different particles
- No chemistry, no life

### Probability

Tunneling probability per unit volume:
$$
P \propto e^{-S}
$$

Very small, but not zero.

Could happen anytime, anywhere.

## The Big Snap

### Cosmic String Catastrophe

If cosmic strings exist and are unstable:
- String network decays violently
- Energy released in gravitational waves
- Spacetime disrupted

### The Scenario

```
Stable network:
∿∿∿∿∿∿∿∿∿∿∿∿

Instability develops:
∿∿∿∿╳∿∿∿∿∿∿∿

Cascade:
∿∿∿╳∿╳∿╳∿∿∿

Spacetime disruption:
* * * * * * * * * * * * *
```

Speculative, but possible.

## In the Simulation

### Modeling Alternative Endings

```python
def simulate_big_rip(universe, w=-1.5):
    # Phantom dark energy (w < -1)
    while True:
        # Dark energy density increases
        s = universe.scale
        exponent = -3 * (1 + w)
        rho_de = initial_rho * s**exponent

        # Apply dark energy expansion
        expansion_rate = sqrt(rho_de)
        universe.expand(expansion_rate)

        # Check for rip
        if expansion_rate > INFINITY_THRESHOLD:
            print("Big Rip occurred!")
            break

        universe.step()

def simulate_big_crunch(universe, turn_time):
    for tick in range(turn_time):
        universe.step()
        universe.expand(slow_rate)

    # Reverse expansion
    while universe.size > PLANCK_SIZE:
        universe.step()
        universe.contract(accelerating_rate)

    print("Big Crunch!")

def simulate_vacuum_decay(universe):
    for tick in range(MAX_TICKS):
        # Check for spontaneous nucleation
        for voxel in universe.grid:
            if random() < DECAY_PROBABILITY:
                # Nucleate true vacuum bubble
                bubble = create_true_vacuum_bubble(voxel)
                universe.add_bubble(bubble)

        # Expand existing bubbles
        for bubble in universe.bubbles:
            bubble.expand_at_c()

        universe.step()
```

## Comparison of Endings

| Ending | Cause | Timescale | Survival? |
|--------|-------|-----------|-----------|
| Heat Death | Entropy | 10¹⁰⁰+ years | No (eventual) |
| Big Rip | Phantom energy | ~20 Gyr | No |
| Big Crunch | Gravity | Variable | No |
| Big Bounce | Quantum gravity | Cycles | Maybe |
| Big Freeze | Dark energy | 10¹⁴+ years | No (eventual) |
| Vacuum Decay | Quantum tunneling | Random | No |

## The Most Likely Ending

Current evidence favors:
- Cosmological constant (w ≈ -1)
- Eternal expansion
- Heat death via Big Freeze

But measurements have uncertainty:
- w could be slightly < -1 → Rip
- w could change with time → Unknown

## Experiments

### Ending Selector
Choose dark energy equation of state. Watch corresponding fate.

### Vacuum Decay Visualization
See bubble nucleate and expand. Watch physics change.

### Bounce Animation
Run cyclic cosmology. Watch universe contract and re-expand.

## Concepts

- **big-rip**: Phantom energy tears everything apart
- **big-crunch**: Gravity reverses expansion
- **big-bounce**: Crunch followed by new expansion
- **vacuum-decay**: Transition to true vacuum

## Transition

Many possible endings, but one theme unites them: return. Whether through rip, crunch, freeze, or decay, everything returns to a simpler state. The ultimate return is to the Void itself.
