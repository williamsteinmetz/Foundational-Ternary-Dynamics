# Galaxy Interactions {#sec-galaxy-interactions}

*"Cosmic collisions"*

::: {.callout-note}
## Key Revelation
Galaxies don't just drift through space—they collide, merge, and transform each other. These interactions drive galaxy evolution and trigger dramatic starbursts.

## Types of Interactions

### Flyby

Close passage without merger:
- Tidal distortions
- Triggered star formation
- Can repeat (bound orbit)

### Minor Merger

Small galaxy absorbed by large:
- Small galaxy disrupted
- Large galaxy barely affected
- Adds stars to halo
- Common occurrence

### Major Merger

Two comparable galaxies combine:
- Both heavily disrupted
- Dramatic morphological change
- Usually produces elliptical
- Rare but transformative

## Tidal Effects

Gravity from passing galaxy distorts structure:

```
Before:       During:         After:
   ○            ╱○              ─────○
   │           ╱ │               ╲ │
   ●──────────●──────────────────●
               ╲ │               ╱ │
                ╲○              ─────○

Tidal tails form on opposite sides
```

### Tidal Tails

- Stretched material on two sides
- Can extend hundreds of thousands of light-years
- Stars, gas, and dark matter
- Examples: Mice Galaxies, Antennae

### Tidal Dwarf Galaxies

Dense clumps in tidal tails can become small galaxies:
- Formed from debris
- Lack dark matter
- Short-lived?

## Merger Sequence

### Stage 1: Approach
- Galaxies detect each other gravitationally
- Orbits modified
- No visible interaction yet

### Stage 2: First Passage
- Tidal tails form
- Bars may be triggered
- Some gas driven to centers
- First starburst

### Stage 3: Separation
- Galaxies move apart
- Tidal features stretch
- Dynamic friction slows them
- Will return

### Stage 4: Final Coalescence
- Galaxies merge centers
- Violent relaxation
- Black holes merge
- Major starburst
- AGN possibly triggered

### Stage 5: Relaxation
- Merged remnant settles
- Usually elliptical shape
- Star formation fades
- "Post-starburst" phase

## Starbursts

Mergers trigger extreme star formation:

### Mechanism
1. Gas loses angular momentum
2. Flows to galaxy centers
3. High density → rapid star formation
4. Rates 10-100× normal

### Ultra-Luminous Infrared Galaxies (ULIRGs)

Most extreme starbursts:
- $L > 10^{12} L_\odot$
- Heavily dust-obscured
- Shine in infrared
- Often merging systems

## The Fate of Supermassive Black Holes

When galaxies merge, so do their SMBHs:

### Process
1. Black holes sink to merger center (dynamical friction)
2. Form binary (separation ~parsec)
3. Binary hardens (ejects stars)
4. "Final parsec problem"—how do they get closer?
5. Eventually merge → gravitational waves

## Environmental Effects

### Ram Pressure Stripping

In galaxy clusters:
```
Hot cluster gas
       ↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓
    ╭──────────╮
    │  Galaxy  │→ Motion
    │ ═════════│← Gas stripped
    ╰──────────╯
       ↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓
```

Galaxy's gas is swept away.

### Harassment

Repeated high-speed encounters in clusters:
- Heats disk stars
- Thickens disk
- Eventually transforms spiral → S0

### Strangulation

Cut off from fresh gas supply:
- Existing gas consumed
- No new star formation
- Slow fading to red

## Famous Interactions

| System | Type | Distance |
|--------|------|----------|
| Antennae | Major merger | 45 Mly |
| Mice | Early merger | 290 Mly |
| Whirlpool (M51) | Interaction | 23 Mly |
| Cartwheel | Ring galaxy | 500 Mly |

## In Simulation

```python
def galaxy_merger(gal1, gal2):
    # Initial approach
    while separation(gal1, gal2) > tidal_radius:
        evolve_orbits(gal1, gal2)

    # Interaction phase
    while not merged(gal1, gal2):
        # Tidal forces
        apply_tides(gal1, gal2)

        # Gas dynamics
        drive_gas_inflow(gal1)
        drive_gas_inflow(gal2)

        # Star formation
        starburst(gal1.center)
        starburst(gal2.center)

        # Dynamical friction
        slow_relative_motion(gal1, gal2)

    # Coalescence
    remnant = combine(gal1, gal2)
    merge_black_holes(gal1.smbh, gal2.smbh)

    return remnant
```

## Experiments

### Collision Simulator
Set up two galaxies. Watch them merge over billions of years.

### Tidal Tail Formation
Observe how tidal tails develop during close passage.

### Starburst Trigger
Measure star formation rate through merger stages.

## Concepts

- **tidal-interaction**: Gravitational distortion
- **major-merger**: Comparable mass combination
- **starburst**: Intense star formation episode
- **ram-pressure-stripping**: Gas removal by hot ICM

## Transition

Galaxies are embedded in larger structures. Now we scale up to the cosmic realm—the large-scale structure of the universe itself.
