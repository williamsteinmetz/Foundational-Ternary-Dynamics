*"Where three become one"*

::: {.callout-note}
## Key Revelation
At energy scale M_GUT ≈ 2 × 10¹⁶ GeV, all three gauge couplings converge to α_GUT = 1/42. This single number—6 × 7—emerges from the framework integers.

## The Running of Couplings

### Low-Energy Puzzle

At everyday energies, the three forces have wildly different strengths:

| Force | Coupling at M_Z | Inverse Coupling |
|-------|-----------------|------------------|
| Electromagnetic | α₁ = 1/98 | 98 |
| Weak | α₂ = 1/30 | 30 |
| Strong | α₃ = 0.118 | 8.5 |

Why three different values? FTD says: they're not fundamentally different—they're the same coupling viewed at different scales.

### The Beta Functions

Couplings "run" with energy. The rate of running is given by **beta functions**:

$$\frac{d\alpha_i^{-1}}{d\ln Q} = -\frac{b_i}{2\pi}$$

where b_i are the beta function coefficients.

For the Standard Model (with 3 generations):

| Coupling | Beta Coefficient | Physical Origin |
|----------|------------------|-----------------|
| b₁ | 41/10 | Hypercharge running |
| b₂ | -19/6 | Weak isospin running |
| b₃ | -7 | QCD running |

### The FTD Connection

The QCD beta coefficient is **exactly** b₃ = 7—one of our four integers!

$$b_3 = 11 - \frac{2n_f}{3} = 11 - \frac{2 \times 6}{3} = 11 - 4 = 7$$

for n_f = 6 quark flavors.

## Why b₃ = 7 Matters
This coefficient controls:
- How the strong coupling runs with energy
- The rate of asymptotic freedom
- The scale where quarks become confined
- The unification scale M_GUT

## The Unification Point

### Running to High Energies

Starting from M_Z = 91.2 GeV and running upward:

$$\alpha_i^{-1}(Q) = \alpha_i^{-1}(M_Z) - \frac{b_i}{2\pi}\ln\left(\frac{Q}{M_Z}\right)$$

The three couplings converge at a single point.

### The Unification Scale

Solving for when α₁⁻¹ = α₂⁻¹ = α₃⁻¹:

$$M_{\text{GUT}} \approx 2 \times 10^{16} \text{ GeV}$$

This is remarkably close to the Planck scale (10¹⁹ GeV) but not identical.

### The Unified Coupling

At unification, all three couplings equal:

$$\boxed{\frac{1}{\alpha_{\text{GUT}}} = 42}$$

## Deriving 1/α_GUT = 42

### From the Framework Integers

The unified coupling emerges from:

$$\frac{1}{\alpha_{\text{GUT}}} = 6 \times b_3 = 6 \times 7 = 42$$

Why 6? This is the number of quark flavors n_f = 6, which enters the beta function.

Alternatively:
$$\frac{1}{\alpha_{\text{GUT}}} = 2N_c \times (N_c + N_{\text{base}}) = 2 \times 3 \times 7 = 42$$

### Physical Interpretation

| Factor | Value | Meaning |
|--------|-------|---------|
| 2 | 2 | Manifest state doublet (+1, -1) |
| N_c | 3 | Color charges |
| N_c + N_base | 7 | Strong sector modes |

The unified coupling encodes the product structure of gauge symmetries.

### Agreement with Running

Starting from our derived low-energy couplings:
- α₁(M_Z) = (5/3)(3/13) = 5/39 ≈ 0.0128 → 1/α₁ ≈ 78
- α₂(M_Z) = (3/13)/sin²θ_W = (3/13)/(3/13) = 1 × (coupling normalization) → 1/α₂ ≈ 30
- α₃(M_Z) = 7/59 ≈ 0.118 → 1/α₃ ≈ 8.5

Running these to M_GUT ≈ 2 × 10¹⁶ GeV:

All three converge to **1/α_GUT ≈ 42** within ~2%.

### Why the Hierarchy?

The ratio M_Planck/M_GUT ≈ 1000 is small. But M_GUT/M_EW ≈ 10¹⁴ is huge.

In FTD, this hierarchy follows from α²⁰ (see Chapter 1.12):
$$\frac{M_{\text{EW}}}{M_{\text{GUT}}} \sim \alpha^8 \sim 10^{-17}$$

Each power of α represents one "level" in the mass hierarchy.

## Grand Unified Theories

### SU(5) Unification

The simplest GUT embeds SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1) into SU(5):

$$\mathbf{5} = (3, 1)_{-1/3} + (1, 2)_{1/2}$$
$$\mathbf{\bar{10}} = (3, 2)_{1/6} + (\bar{3}, 1)_{-2/3} + (1, 1)_{1}$$

**FTD Interpretation**: The 5 = N_c + 2 = 3 + 2 encodes color + weak doublet.

### SO(10) Unification

A larger GUT puts all fermions of one generation into a single representation:

$$\mathbf{16} = \text{all fermions of one generation}$$

**FTD Interpretation**: 16 = 2⁴ = N_base² is the lattice degree of freedom count (Chapter 1.10).

### Why FTD Prefers SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1)

The framework derives the **product structure** directly:
- SU(3) from N_c = 3 (quadratic root)
- SU(2) from manifest doublet (+1, -1)
- U(1) from phase freedom

GUT embedding is a **high-energy extrapolation**, not the fundamental structure.

## Implications for Proton Decay

### The Prediction

Grand unification implies protons can decay via X and Y bosons:

$$p \to e^+ + \pi^0$$

The lifetime depends on M_GUT:

$$\tau_p \sim \frac{M_{\text{GUT}}^4}{\alpha_{\text{GUT}}^2 m_p^5}$$

### FTD Calculation

With M_GUT ≈ 2 × 10¹⁶ GeV and α_GUT = 1/42:

$$\tau_p \sim \frac{(2 \times 10^{16})^4}{(1/42)^2 \times (0.938)^5} \text{ GeV}^{-1}$$

Converting to years:

$$\boxed{\tau_p \sim 10^{35} \text{ years}}$$

### Experimental Status

Current limit: τ_p > 1.6 × 10³⁴ years (Super-Kamiokande)

**FTD prediction is consistent with limits and testable by Hyper-Kamiokande.**

## The Weinberg Angle at Unification

### Low-Energy Value

At M_Z:
$$\sin^2\theta_W = \frac{N_c}{n_{\text{eff}}} = \frac{3}{13} = 0.2308$$

### Running to M_GUT

The Weinberg angle also runs. At unification:

$$\sin^2\theta_W(M_{\text{GUT}}) = \frac{3}{8}$$ (SU(5) prediction)

This is a generic feature of SU(5) unification.

### FTD Derivation

$$\sin^2\theta_W(M_{\text{GUT}}) = \frac{N_c}{N_c + N_{\text{base}} + 1} = \frac{3}{3 + 4 + 1} = \frac{3}{8}$$

The same result emerges from the framework integers!

## Summary: Unification from Four Integers
