## Key Insight
At the smallest scales, spacetime exhibits discrete structure. The lattice spacing defines a fundamental length below which no further subdivision is possible.

## The Grain of Reality

Zoom in far enough, and you hit a floor. Space is not continuous—it is a lattice of discrete cells.

### Planck Units (Simulation)

| Quantity | Symbol | FTD Value | Physical Scale |
|----------|--------|-----------|----------------|
| Planck length | $\ell_P$ | 1 voxel | $1.6 \times 10^{-35}$ m |
| Planck time | $t_P$ | 1 tick | $5.4 \times 10^{-44}$ s |
| Planck energy | $E_P$ | 1 (lattice unit) | $1.22 \times 10^{19}$ GeV |
| Manifestation threshold | $K_B$ | $\sim \alpha^{11}$ | 0.511 MeV (electron mass) |

**Important distinction**: The Planck energy $E_P$ sets the overall energy scale of the lattice (one flux unit in natural units). The manifestation threshold $K_B \approx 0.511$ MeV is the *minimum energy required for particle creation*—derived as $K_B = m_P \sqrt{2\pi} \cdot (16/3) \cdot \alpha^{11}$ (see @sec-constants). These differ by $\sim 24$ orders of magnitude: $K_B/E_P \sim 10^{-24}$, which is precisely $\alpha^{11}$.

The discreteness is fundamental: no physical process can resolve distances smaller than one voxel or time intervals shorter than one tick.

## What Happens at the Planck Scale

### Space is Granular
No continuous positions exist. Only integer coordinates matter. A particle at (3.7, 2.1, 5.9) is really at (4, 2, 6) with a position remainder tracking the fractional part.

### Time is Quantized
Events happen at discrete ticks, not between them. There is no "halfway through tick 47"—tick 47 either has happened or hasn't.

### Causality is Strict
Maximum influence: 1 voxel per tick. This isn't a speed limit—it's a causality limit. No physical process can violate it.

### Uncertainty is Geometric
What appears as quantum uncertainty is actually sub-voxel position tracking **[CONJECTURE: this reinterpretation requires validation against full quantum predictions]**. The `position_remainder` accumulates until it triggers a discrete jump.

## Discreteness

### No Infinitesimals
Zeno's paradox dissolves. You cannot subdivide space forever because there is a smallest unit. Motion is not continuous—it is a series of discrete jumps.

### Integer Lattice
Position coordinates are integers: (x, y, z) where x, y, z ∈ ℤ

Neighbors are at distance 1 (6 face neighbors) or √2 (12 edge neighbors) or √3 (8 corner neighbors). Total: 26 neighbors in the Moore neighborhood.

### Sub-Voxel Tracking
When physics demands fractional positions, we track them:

```python
# Fractional position accumulates
position_remainder += fractional_velocity
# When it exceeds threshold, discrete jump
if |position_remainder| >= 1:
    position += sign(position_remainder)
    position_remainder -= sign(position_remainder)
```

## The Quantum Foam

At the Planck scale, the Void itself fluctuates.

### Virtual Pair Production
When energy density approaches KB, virtual particle pairs briefly manifest:
- Appear for a tick or two
- Annihilate before becoming real
- Create a "foamy" texture in the vacuum

### Flux Turbulence
The flux field churns at small scales:
- Random fluctuations
- Short-lived vortices
- Constant activity beneath the apparent stillness

### Vacuum Energy
Even "empty" space has energy:
- Baseline flux fluctuations
- Zero-point motion
- The Void is never truly still

## Into the Grid

Zoom into a region of space:

```
Scale 0 (macroscopic): Smooth, continuous-looking
Scale -1: Some pixelation visible
Scale -2: Clearly discrete structure
Scale -3 (Planck): Individual voxels visible

Each voxel: A single cell with state (0, +1, or -1)
           Plus flux, density, phase, velocity...
```

## Position Remainder

When a particle moves at fractional velocity:

| Tick | Velocity | Remainder | Position | Jump? |
|------|----------|-----------|----------|-------|
| 0 | 0.3 | 0.0 | 0 | No |
| 1 | 0.3 | 0.3 | 0 | No |
| 2 | 0.3 | 0.6 | 0 | No |
| 3 | 0.3 | 0.9 | 0 | No |
| 4 | 0.3 | 1.2→0.2 | 1 | Yes! |

The particle "waits" until accumulated motion justifies a jump.

## Experiments

### Voxel Visualization
Zoom to Planck scale. See individual voxels. Watch states flicker.

### Position Tracking
Follow a slow particle. Watch its position remainder accumulate. See the discrete jumps.

### Vacuum Fluctuations
Observe "empty" space at Planck scale. See the virtual pairs, the foam, the activity.

## Concepts

- **discreteness**: Space and time have minimum units
- **voxel**: The fundamental cell of space
- **position-remainder**: Sub-voxel position tracking
- **quantum-foam**: Vacuum fluctuations at Planck scale

## Transition

We've seen the grain of reality. Now let's examine what each grain contains—the anatomy of a voxel.
