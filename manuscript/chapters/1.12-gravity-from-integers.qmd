# Gravity from the Four Integers {#sec-gravity-integers}

*"Why is gravity 10³⁹ times weaker than electromagnetism?"*

::: {.callout-note}
## Key Revelation
The gravitational hierarchy—the mysterious 10³⁹ ratio between gravity and other forces—emerges entirely from the four integers {3, 4, 7, 13} through twenty powers of α.

## The Hierarchy Problem

Gravity is absurdly weak compared to other forces:

| Force | Relative Strength | Ratio to Gravity |
|-------|------------------|------------------|
| Strong | 1 | 10³⁹ |
| Electromagnetic | 10⁻² | 10³⁷ |
| Weak | 10⁻⁶ | 10³³ |
| **Gravity** | **10⁻³⁹** | **1** |

Why this enormous hierarchy? Standard physics has no explanation—it's one of the biggest unsolved problems. FTD derives it.

## The Gravitational Coupling

### Definition

The gravitational fine structure constant:

$$\alpha_G = \frac{G_N m_p^2}{\hbar c} \approx 5.91 \times 10^{-39}$$

This measures gravity's strength between two protons.

### The Key Insight

$$\alpha_G = \left(\frac{m_p}{m_P}\right)^2$$

where:
- $m_p$ = proton mass (938 MeV)
- $m_P$ = Planck mass (1.22 × 10¹⁹ GeV)

**Gravity is weak because protons are light compared to the Planck scale.**

So the question becomes: why is $m_p/m_P \approx 10^{-19.5}$?

## The Derivation Chain

### Step 1: The Proton-Electron Mass Ratio

From the framework integers (see Chapter 1.10 for the primary derivation):

$$\frac{m_p}{m_e} = \frac{n_{\text{eff}}}{\alpha} + T(b_3 + N_c)$$

where $T(n) = n(n+1)/2$ is the nth triangular number.

Substituting {N_c = 3, b₃ = 7, n_eff = 13}:

$$\frac{m_p}{m_e} = \frac{13}{1/137.036} + T(10) = 13 \times 137.036 + 55 = 1781.47 + 55 = 1836.47$$

**Experimental value**: 1836.15
**Agreement**: 99.98% (0.02% error)

::: {.callout-note}
## Formula Reconciliation
An alternative approximation $(n_{\text{eff}} + N_c/b_3)/\alpha = (94/7) \times 137 \approx 1840$ appears in some derivations but the triangular number formula above is more accurate and is the canonical form.

### Step 2: The Electron Mass

From Chapter 1.10 (Lemniscate-Alpha):

$$m_e = m_P \cdot \sqrt{2\pi} \cdot \frac{N_{\text{base}}^2}{N_c} \cdot \alpha^{11}$$

With N_base = 4, N_c = 3:

$$m_e = m_P \cdot \sqrt{2\pi} \cdot \frac{16}{3} \cdot \alpha^{11}$$

The α¹¹ suppression is why the electron is so much lighter than the Planck mass.

### Step 3: The Proton Mass

Combining Steps 1 and 2:

$$m_p = m_e \cdot \frac{n_{\text{eff}} + N_c/b_3}{\alpha}$$

$$m_p = m_P \cdot \sqrt{2\pi} \cdot \frac{16}{3} \cdot \left(n_{\text{eff}} + \frac{N_c}{b_3}\right) \cdot \alpha^{10}$$

The proton carries α¹⁰ (one power less than the electron due to strong binding).

### Step 4: The Gravitational Coupling

$$\alpha_G = \left(\frac{m_p}{m_P}\right)^2 = 2\pi \cdot \left(\frac{N_{\text{base}}^2}{N_c}\right)^2 \cdot \left(n_{\text{eff}} + \frac{N_c}{b_3}\right)^2 \cdot \alpha^{20}$$

Substituting all integers:

$$\alpha_G = 2\pi \cdot \left(\frac{16}{3}\right)^2 \cdot \left(\frac{94}{7}\right)^2 \cdot \alpha^{20}$$

## The Result

**FTD Prediction**: α_G = 5.909 × 10⁻³⁹

**Experimental Value**: α_G = 5.906 × 10⁻³⁹

**Agreement**: 99.94% (0.06% error)

## What This Means

The 10³⁹ hierarchy is **not arbitrary**. It arises because:

1. **α²⁰ factor**: Twenty powers of the fine structure constant
2. **Geometric prefactors**: Products of the framework integers

Every piece of this formula traces back to {3, 4, 7, 13}.
:::

## Why Twenty Powers of α?

The gravitational coupling involves **two** powers of the proton mass, each carrying α¹⁰:

$$\alpha_G \sim m_p^2 \sim (\alpha^{10})^2 = \alpha^{20}$$

Each factor of α represents one level of the mass hierarchy:
- α¹: electromagnetic corrections
- α²: binding energy scale
- ...
- α¹⁰: QCD confinement scale (proton mass)
- α²⁰: gravitational coupling (square of proton mass ratio)

## The Lattice Derivation

### Why G_N = 1/(b₃ + N_c)²?

From Chapter 1.10, the gravitational bias:

$$G_{\text{bias}} = \frac{1}{(b_3 + N_c)^2} = \frac{1}{(7+3)^2} = \frac{1}{100} = 0.01$$

This is the **dimensionless** gravitational coupling in lattice units.

The combination b₃ + N_c = 10 represents:
- b₃ = 7: QCD beta function (gluon self-coupling)
- N_c = 3: Color charges

Their sum encodes "strong sector complexity." Gravity couples inversely to the square—the same geometric form as 1/r² force law.

### An Elegant Identity

Note that:
$$n_{\text{eff}} - N_c = 13 - 3 = 10 = b_3 + N_c$$

This connects the effective dimension to the strong sector, suggesting gravity emerges from the same geometric structure as the gauge forces.

## Inverse-Square Law from Geometry

### Flux Conservation

The flux field J satisfies Gauss's law. For a spherical source:

$$\oint_{S_r} \mathbf{J} \cdot d\mathbf{A} = \Phi_0$$

Since the surface area of a sphere is 4πr²:

$$|\mathbf{J}(r)| = \frac{\Phi_0}{4\pi r^2}$$

**The inverse-square law is purely geometric—a consequence of flux conservation in 3D space.**

### The Force Law

With density ρ = |J| and gravitational coupling G_N:

$$\mathbf{F}_g = -G_N \cdot m \cdot \nabla\rho$$

For a point mass M:

$$\boxed{\mathbf{F}_g = -\frac{G_N M m}{r^2}\hat{r}}$$

Newton's law of gravitation emerges from flux geometry.

## Connection to General Relativity

### The Effective Metric

Flux density gradients can be recast as spacetime curvature:

$$g_{\mu\nu} = \eta_{\mu\nu} + h_{\mu\nu}$$

where:
$$h_{00} = -\frac{2\Phi}{c^2}$$

with Φ the Newtonian potential.

### Geodesic Motion

Particles following flux gradients are equivalently following geodesics in the effective metric:

$$\frac{d^2 x^\mu}{d\tau^2} + \Gamma^\mu_{\alpha\beta} \frac{dx^\alpha}{d\tau}\frac{dx^\beta}{d\tau} = 0$$

**FTD particles on flux gradients = GR particles on geodesics**

### Gravitational Waves

Accelerating masses create propagating flux ripples:

$$\Box h_{\mu\nu} = -16\pi G_N T_{\mu\nu}$$

These are gravitational waves—transverse flux oscillations traveling at speed C.

## Predictions

### No Large Extra Dimensions

Theories with large extra dimensions predict modified gravity at short distances. FTD predicts inverse-square all the way down to the Planck scale—no anomalies.

### Gravitational Constant is Fundamental

G_N is not a random parameter—it's derived from the same integers that give α. Any universe with our gauge structure has this gravitational hierarchy.

### Matter-Antimatter Symmetry in Gravity

Since gravity couples to flux density |J|², not charge, matter and antimatter gravitate identically. This is a prediction, not an input.

## Concepts

- **gravitational-hierarchy**: The 10³⁹ ratio between gravity and strong force
- **alpha-G**: Gravitational fine structure constant = G_N m_p²/(ℏc)
- **inverse-square-law**: F ∝ 1/r² from flux conservation in 3D
- **effective-metric**: Flux density → spacetime curvature correspondence
- **geodesic-motion**: Particle trajectories as curves through effective geometry
- **gravitational-waves**: Transverse flux ripples from accelerating masses

## Transition

We've seen how all four forces—strong, electromagnetic, weak, and gravitational—emerge from the flux field and derive their strengths from the four integers. The weak force transforms particles; gravity shapes spacetime. But what happens when we zoom out to cosmic scales? The next book explores the Planck scale and subatomic realm where these forces play out.
