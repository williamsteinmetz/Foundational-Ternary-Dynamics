*"The electron sea"*

::: {.callout-note}
## Key Revelation
Metals conduct because their electrons are delocalized—not bound to individual atoms but free to flow throughout the material. The electron sea explains all metallic properties.

## How FTD Produces Metallic Conduction
The "electron sea" arises naturally from FTD's flux structure:

- **Delocalized electrons** = flux distributions spanning the entire lattice rather than localized around nuclei
- **Conductivity** = flux can propagate freely through the extended electron wavefunction
- **Resistance** = flux scattering from lattice vibrations (phonons) and impurities
- **Fermi surface** = boundary in flux-momentum space between occupied and unoccupied states

Band theory emerges from the periodic boundary conditions of flux in a crystalline lattice.

## The Electron Sea Model

In metals, valence electrons are shared among all atoms.

```
⊕ e⁻ ⊕ e⁻ ⊕ e⁻ ⊕ e⁻
e⁻ ⊕ e⁻ ⊕ e⁻ ⊕ e⁻ ⊕
⊕ e⁻ ⊕ e⁻ ⊕ e⁻ ⊕ e⁻
e⁻ ⊕ e⁻ ⊕ e⁻ ⊕ e⁻ ⊕

⊕ = metal cation (fixed)
e⁻ = delocalized electron (mobile)
```

## Properties Explained

### Electrical Conductivity

Electrons move freely in response to electric field:
$$
\vec{J} = \sigma \vec{E}
$$

Current flows because electrons can move without jumping between atoms.

### Thermal Conductivity

Electrons carry heat:
$$
\kappa = \frac{1}{3} C_v v \lambda
$$

Metals conduct heat well because electrons move fast and far.

### Malleability and Ductility

Layers of ions can slide past each other without breaking bonds—the electron sea reforms around the new positions.

```
Before:  ⊕ ⊕ ⊕    After:  ⊕ ⊕ ⊕
         ⊕ ⊕ ⊕            ⊕ ⊕ ⊕
                  →           (slid)
```

### Metallic Luster

Free electrons oscillate in response to light and re-emit it—metals are shiny.

### Opacity

Electrons absorb photons across a continuous range—metals are opaque.

## Band Theory

A more sophisticated view of electron behavior.

### Energy Bands

- **Valence band**: Filled electron states
- **Conduction band**: Empty or partially filled states
- **Band gap**: Energy difference between bands

### Metal Band Structure

```
Energy
  ↑
  │  ╔═══════════╗
  │  ║           ║ ← Conduction band
  │  ║  Partially║   (partially filled)
  │  ║  filled   ║
  │  ╚═══════════╝
  │  No gap!
  │  ╔═══════════╗
  │  ║  Filled   ║ ← Valence band
  │  ╚═══════════╝
  └───────────────→
```

No gap between valence and conduction bands—electrons can move freely.

## Resistance

Even metals have some resistance.

### Sources
- **Phonon scattering**: Vibrating atoms deflect electrons
- **Impurity scattering**: Foreign atoms deflect electrons
- **Defect scattering**: Lattice imperfections deflect electrons

### Temperature Dependence

$$
\rho(T) = \rho_0 (1 + \alpha T)
$$

Resistance increases with temperature (more phonons).

## Conductivity Values

| Material | Conductivity (S/m) | Notes |
|----------|-------------------|-------|
| Silver | 6.3 × 10⁷ | Best conductor |
| Copper | 5.9 × 10⁷ | Most common wire |
| Gold | 4.5 × 10⁷ | Corrosion resistant |
| Aluminum | 3.8 × 10⁷ | Lightweight |
| Iron | 1.0 × 10⁷ | Magnetic |
| Graphite | 10⁵ | Layered conductor |
| Glass | 10⁻¹² | Insulator |

## Free Electron Model

Treating electrons as non-interacting particles.

### Fermi Energy

Maximum electron energy at absolute zero:
$$
E_F = \frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\left(\frac{3\pi^2 n}{V}\right)^{2/3}
$$

### Fermi Velocity

$$
v_F = \sqrt{\frac{2E_F}{m}} \approx 10^6 \text{ m/s}
$$

Electrons at the Fermi surface move very fast.

### Fermi-Dirac Distribution

Probability of state being occupied:
$$
f(E) = \frac{1}{e^{(E-E_F)/k_BT} + 1}
$$

At T = 0, sharp cutoff at $E_F$.

## In Simulation

```python
class MetalRegion:
    def __init__(self, atoms):
        self.ions = atoms  # Fixed positive ions
        self.electrons = pool_electrons(atoms)  # Shared

    def apply_field(self, E_field):
        for electron in self.electrons:
            # Electrons respond to field
            electron.flux += ELECTRON_CHARGE * E_field
            # Random scattering
            if random() < scattering_rate:
                randomize_direction(electron.flux)
```

## Transition

Metals conduct freely. Insulators don't conduct at all. Between them are semiconductors—the basis of modern electronics.
