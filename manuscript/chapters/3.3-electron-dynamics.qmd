*"How electrons orbit, bond, and determine chemistry"*

::: {.callout-note}
## Key Revelation
Electron behavior follows simple rules: minimize energy, fill shells, share or transfer to achieve stability. All of chemistry flows from these principles.

## Shell Filling Rules

### Aufbau Principle

Electrons fill orbitals in order of increasing energy:

```
1s → 2s → 2p → 3s → 3p → 4s → 3d → 4p →
5s → 4d → 5p → 6s → 4f → 5d → 6p →
7s → 5f → 6d → 7p
```

The 4s fills before 3d because it has lower energy.

### Pauli Exclusion

No two electrons can have identical quantum numbers.

In simulation: same-state particles repel at short range, preventing overlap.

### Hund's Rule

Electrons fill degenerate orbitals singly before pairing.

Why? Parallel spins minimize electron-electron repulsion.

## Orbital Mechanics

### Angular Momentum

Orbital angular momentum is quantized:
$$
L = \sqrt{\ell(\ell+1)} \hbar
$$

where $\ell$ is the **azimuthal quantum number** (0, 1, 2, 3... for s, p, d, f orbitals respectively).

## Quantum Numbers
- **Principal quantum number** $n$ (1, 2, 3...) determines energy level
- **Azimuthal quantum number** $\ell$ (0 to n-1) determines orbital shape and angular momentum
- **Magnetic quantum number** $m_\ell$ (-$\ell$ to +$\ell$) determines orbital orientation
- **Spin quantum number** $m_s$ (±½) determines electron spin
:::

In simulation: stable orbits occur where angular momentum satisfies the quantization condition.

### Energy Levels

For hydrogen-like atoms:
$$
E_n = -\frac{13.6 \times Z^2}{n^2} \text{ eV}
$$

Where Z is the atomic number and n is the principal quantum number.

### Probability Distributions

Orbitals define where electrons are likely to be:

| Orbital | Shape | Nodes |
|---------|-------|-------|
| s | Sphere | 0 angular |
| p | Dumbbell | 1 angular |
| d | Cloverleaf | 2 angular |
| f | Complex | 3 angular |

## Ionization and Electron Affinity

### Ionization

Removing an electron requires energy:
$$
\text{Na} \rightarrow \text{Na}^+ + e^-
$$

First ionization energy varies across the table:
- Alkali metals: Low (easy to remove)
- Noble gases: High (hard to remove)

### Electron Affinity

Adding an electron releases energy:
$$
\text{Cl} + e^- \rightarrow \text{Cl}^-
$$

Halogens have high electron affinity—they want one more electron to complete their shell.

## Valence and Reactivity

### Valence Electrons

Electrons in the outermost shell. Determine:
- Chemical reactivity
- Bond formation
- Ion charge

### The Octet Rule

Atoms are most stable with 8 valence electrons (full s²p⁶).

Atoms achieve this by:
- **Losing electrons** (metals): Na → Na⁺
- **Gaining electrons** (nonmetals): Cl → Cl⁻
- **Sharing electrons** (covalent): C-C bonds

## Transitions and Spectra

When electrons change energy levels:

### Absorption
$$
E_{\text{photon}} = E_{\text{final}} - E_{\text{initial}}
$$
Electron absorbs photon, jumps to higher energy.

### Emission
$$
E_{\text{photon}} = E_{\text{initial}} - E_{\text{final}}
$$
Electron emits photon, drops to lower energy.

### Spectral Lines

Each element has unique energy levels, creating unique spectral fingerprints.

## Spin

Electrons have intrinsic angular momentum (spin):
- Spin up: +½
- Spin down: -½

Two electrons can share an orbital only if they have opposite spin.

## Experiments

### Orbital Visualization
See the probability clouds for s, p, d, f orbitals.

### Spectral Lines
Excite atoms. Watch emission spectra. Identify the element by its fingerprint.

### Ionization
Remove electrons one by one. Measure ionization energies.

## Implementation

```python
def find_shell(electron, nucleus):
    # Calculate distance from nucleus
    r = distance(electron.position, nucleus.position)

    # Determine shell based on radius
    if r < 6:
        return 1  # 1s
    elif r < 10:
        return 2  # 2s, 2p
    elif r < 14:
        return 3  # 3s, 3p
    else:
        return 4  # Higher shells

def is_shell_full(shell, electron_count):
    max_electrons = {1: 2, 2: 8, 3: 18, 4: 32}
    return electron_count >= max_electrons[shell]
```

## Concepts

- **aufbau**: Order of orbital filling
- **pauli-exclusion**: No identical quantum states
- **valence**: Outer electrons determining chemistry
- **spectral-lines**: Energy-level transitions

## Transition

Electrons in atoms are governed by quantum rules. But what happens inside the nucleus? Next, we explore nuclear physics—fusion, fission, and radioactive decay.
