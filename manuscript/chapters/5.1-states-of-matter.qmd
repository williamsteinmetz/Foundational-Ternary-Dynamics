# States of Matter {#sec-states-matter}

*"Solid, liquid, gas—and beyond"*

::: {.callout-note}
## Key Revelation
The same atoms behave completely differently depending on temperature and pressure. Phase is about motion, not identity.

## How FTD Produces Thermodynamics
Temperature, pressure, and phase are emergent properties in FTD:

- **Kinetic energy** = average squared velocity of manifested particles
- **Temperature** emerges as a proxy: $T_{\text{proxy}} = \langle|\vec{J}|^2\rangle / 3N$
- **Pressure** = rate of flux exchange at system boundaries
- **Phase** = classification based on density, mobility, and correlation length

Standard thermodynamic laws (PV = nRT, entropy increase) emerge in the continuum limit. For the rigorous derivation, see THEORETICAL_FOUNDATIONS Part IV: Statistical Mechanics.

## The Four Primary States

| State | Density | Order | Particle Motion |
|-------|---------|-------|-----------------|
| Solid | High | Long-range | Vibration in place |
| Liquid | High | Short-range | Flow, but touch |
| Gas | Low | None | Free movement |
| Plasma | Low | None | Ionized, free electrons |

![The four primary states of matter and their characteristic properties.](../figures/ch05/fig-states-of-matter-panels.png){#fig-states-of-matter}

## Solid

Particles locked in fixed positions.

### Properties
- Definite shape and volume
- Incompressible
- Particles vibrate around fixed points
- Long-range order (crystalline) or short-range (amorphous)

### Types
- **Crystalline**: Regular lattice (salt, diamond)
- **Amorphous**: No long-range order (glass, plastic)

## Liquid

Particles touching but mobile.

### Properties
- Definite volume, no definite shape
- Nearly incompressible
- Particles slide past each other
- Short-range order only

### Unique Features
- Surface tension (inward force from cohesion)
- Viscosity (resistance to flow)
- Capillary action (climbing narrow tubes)

## Gas

Particles far apart and free.

### Properties
- No definite shape or volume
- Highly compressible
- Particles move randomly
- No order

### Gas Laws

**Ideal Gas Law**:
$$
PV = nRT
$$

where R = 8.314 J/(mol·K) is the ideal gas constant, P is pressure, V is volume, n is the number of moles, and T is temperature.

**Kinetic Theory**:
$$
\frac{3}{2}kT = \frac{1}{2}mv^2_{\text{avg}}
$$

Temperature IS average kinetic energy.

## Plasma

Ionized gas—electrons freed from atoms.

### Properties
- Electrically conductive
- Responds to magnetic fields
- Emits light
- Most common state in the universe

### Where Found
- Stars (99% of visible matter)
- Lightning
- Neon signs
- Fusion reactors

## Temperature in Simulation

Temperature emerges from particle motion. In FTD, we define a **temperature proxy** that mirrors the kinetic theory result:

$$
T_{\text{proxy}} = \frac{\langle|\vec{J}|^2\rangle}{3N}
$$

::: {.callout-note}
## Dimensional Analysis
In physical units, kinetic theory gives $\frac{3}{2}k_B T = \frac{1}{2}m\langle v^2\rangle$, so $T = \frac{m\langle v^2\rangle}{3k_B}$. In FTD natural units where flux $|J|$ serves as a momentum proxy and we set $k_B = 1$, the temperature proxy has dimensions of energy per particle. The factor of 3 accounts for three spatial dimensions (equipartition theorem).
:::

Higher average squared flux magnitude = higher temperature.

## Pressure in Simulation

Pressure from particle collisions with boundaries:

$$
P = \frac{F}{A} = \frac{\text{momentum transfer}}{\text{area} \times \text{time}}
$$

## Phase in the Lattice

Phase determined by:
1. **Density**: Particles per region
2. **Temperature proxy**: Average |flux|
3. **Order parameter**: How correlated are neighbor positions?

```python
def determine_phase(region):
    density = count_particles(region) / region.volume
    temperature = average_flux_magnitude(region)
    order = correlation_length(region)

    if density > HIGH and order > LONG_RANGE:
        return SOLID
    elif density > HIGH and order > SHORT_RANGE:
        return LIQUID
    elif density < LOW:
        if ionized(region):
            return PLASMA
        else:
            return GAS
```

## Experiments

### Heat and Cool
Start with solid. Add energy. Watch transition to liquid, then gas.

### Pressure Changes
Compress a gas. See density increase, temperature rise.

### Phase Boundaries
Map the conditions where different phases exist.

## Concepts

- **solid**: Fixed positions, long-range order
- **liquid**: Touching, flowing, short-range order
- **gas**: Separated, free motion
- **plasma**: Ionized gas

## Chapter Summary
**Matter exists in four primary phases**: solid (fixed positions, long-range order), liquid (touching but mobile, short-range order), gas (separated, no order), and plasma (ionized, responds to fields). **Temperature emerges** as average kinetic flux: T_proxy = ⟨|J|²⟩/3N. **Phase is determined** by density, temperature proxy, and correlation length. The same atoms behave completely differently depending on conditions—phase is about motion, not identity. Plasma is the most common state in the universe (99% of visible matter is in stars).

## Transition

States exist in equilibrium under specific conditions. At the boundaries, transitions occur. Next, we explore phase transitions—melting, boiling, and more in @sec-phase-transitions.
