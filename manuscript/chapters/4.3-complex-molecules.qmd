# Complex Molecules {#sec-complex-molecules}

*"Organic chemistry and beyond"*

::: {.callout-note}
## Key Revelation
Carbon's ability to form four bonds creates unlimited molecular possibilities. Add nitrogen, oxygen, and other atoms, and you have the chemistry of life.
:::

## Carbon: The Backbone of Complexity

Why carbon?
- 4 valence electrons → 4 bonds
- Can bond to itself → chains and rings
- Right size → stable bonds
- Multiple bond types → single, double, triple

## Hydrocarbons

Molecules of just carbon and hydrogen.

### Alkanes (Single Bonds)

| Formula | Name | Structure | Notes |
|---------|------|-----------|-------|
| CH₄ | Methane | Tetrahedral | Natural gas |
| C₂H₆ | Ethane | Two tetrahedra | |
| C₃H₈ | Propane | Chain | Fuel |
| C₄H₁₀ | Butane | Chain | Lighter fluid |
| C₅H₁₂ | Pentane | Chain | Solvent |

General formula: CₙH₂ₙ₊₂

### Alkenes (Double Bonds)

| Formula | Name | Notes |
|---------|------|-------|
| C₂H₄ | Ethylene | Planar, ripening agent |
| C₃H₆ | Propene | Plastic precursor |

General formula: CₙH₂ₙ

### Alkynes (Triple Bonds)

| Formula | Name | Notes |
|---------|------|-------|
| C₂H₂ | Acetylene | Linear, welding fuel |
| C₃H₄ | Propyne | |

General formula: CₙH₂ₙ₋₂

### Aromatic Compounds

Ring structures with alternating double bonds.

```
    H
    |
H-C   C-H
  ‖   |
H-C   C-H
    |
    H

Benzene: C₆H₆
Six-membered ring with resonance.
```

## Functional Groups

The reactive parts of molecules.

| Group | Formula | Name | Example |
|-------|---------|------|---------|
| -OH | R-OH | Alcohol | Ethanol |
| -CHO | R-CHO | Aldehyde | Formaldehyde |
| -COOH | R-COOH | Carboxylic acid | Acetic acid |
| -NH₂ | R-NH₂ | Amine | Methylamine |
| -SH | R-SH | Thiol | Methanethiol |
| C=O | R-CO-R' | Ketone | Acetone |
| -O- | R-O-R' | Ether | Diethyl ether |
| -COO- | R-COO-R' | Ester | Ethyl acetate |

### Alcohols

Hydroxyl group (-OH) on carbon:
```
    H   H
    |   |
H - C - C - OH
    |   |
    H   H

Ethanol (drinking alcohol)
```

### Acids and Bases

**Carboxylic acids** donate H⁺:
```
     O
     ‖
R - C - OH → R - C - O⁻ + H⁺
```

**Amines** accept H⁺:
```
R - NH₂ + H⁺ → R - NH₃⁺
```

## Isomers

Same formula, different structure.

### Structural Isomers

Different connectivity:
```
Butane: CH₃-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃
        vs
Isobutane: CH₃-CH(CH₃)-CH₃
```

### Stereoisomers

Same connectivity, different spatial arrangement:
- **Cis-trans**: Around double bonds
- **Enantiomers**: Mirror images (chirality)

### Chirality

A carbon with 4 different groups is chiral:
```
        A
        |
    B—C*—D
        |
        E

Mirror images are not superimposable.
```

This matters in biology—life uses only one "handedness" of amino acids.

## Reactions

### Combustion
```
CH₄ + 2O₂ → CO₂ + 2H₂O + energy
```

### Substitution
One group replaces another.

### Addition
Atoms add across double bond.

### Elimination
Double bond forms, atoms leave.

## Experiments

## Concepts

- **hydrocarbon**: C and H only
- **functional-group**: Reactive part of molecule
- **isomer**: Same formula, different structure
- **chirality**: Mirror-image asymmetry

## Transition

Complex molecules are still small compared to the giants of chemistry. Next, we explore macromolecules—proteins, polymers, and DNA.
